## v2.5.0 — Current Release

**The biggest update since launch.** v2.5.0 isn't about new app categories — chat, image & video generation, the coding agent and the model manager were already here — it's a deep upgrade to all of them, plus several genuinely new tools. Everything still runs 100% on your own machine, and your chats, models, and settings carry over automatically.

Auto-update prompts on next launch.

### 🤖 A much smarter Coding Agent
The coding agent got a full overhaul: a plan-first **Architect mode**, whole-codebase awareness (**Repo-Map**, Aider-style PageRank), **review-before-apply diffs**, a read-only **Code-Review mode**, a **test-runner loop**, **background jobs** that survive a restart, **typed Git/GitHub tools**, **multi-repo** workspaces, and per-project **`.lurules`**. Iteration caps raised to 200 / 400.

### 🪶 Small-Model Mode *(new)*
One switch tunes the app so compact **3B–8B** local models follow instructions and call tools far more reliably (off by default). Plus new **sub-4GB uncensored tool-callers** and **weight-class filters** in Discover so you find models that fit your machine.

### 🎚️ Real context control *(new)*
Set the **context window per model** and watch **true token usage**. Before v2.5.0, LU never forwarded `num_ctx` to Ollama, so it silently capped at 2048 and clipped long chats + RAG — now it honours your setting. Plus one-click **load/unload** of any local model from memory.

### 🎙️ Voice that actually works
**Talk-to-type** with live, on-device transcription (nothing is ever sent automatically) and **read-aloud** in a natural neural voice, both set up with one-click installers. The mic was effectively dead before this release; now it's solid.

### 🎨 Fresh design & everyday UX
A calmer theme with floating panels and a **one-click light/dark toggle**, your own **profile picture**, a per-message **action bar** (copy / regenerate / edit / read-aloud), an **editable memory** brain icon, and **unlimited chat history** — chats & memories moved to a local database, so long, image-heavy threads no longer get cut off.

### 🖼️ Create-tab upgrades
On top of the existing image/video generation: a **LoRA picker**, **VAE override** and **CLIP-skip**, a **model picker right next to Generate**, a **Text-to-Video / Image-to-Video switch** on the main screen, generated images shown inline in chat, and a rebuilt **flicker-free media viewer**.

### 📦 Model Manager & hardware
A refreshed layout with **weight-class filters**, **resumable multi-part (sharded) downloads** with a size confirmation, **per-row LM Studio load/unload**, a fixed INSTALLED badge, and a new **GPU picker** (Settings → Hardware) to pin which card runs your models on multi-GPU rigs.

### 🧰 New tools & reliability
- **Import your chat history** — bring ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini exports into your local knowledge base.
- **Troubleshoot panel** — per-backend health (Ollama / ComfyUI / LM Studio) plus system facts.
- **Reliability** — your chats & settings now survive restarts *and* updates (a major fix), no more stuck "ComfyUI starting…", a phantom GPU entry is gone, credentials are redacted from logs, and `console.log` is stripped from production builds.
- Plus reporter-driven fixes (context window, download routing + badges, Hermes 3 pulls, backend persistence).

### ☁️ Optional cloud waitlist
A small, dismissible badge to be notified if a hosted version ever arrives — it only sends an email address you choose to type in. Everything else stays on your device.

### Stability
Frontend test suite: **2,725 tests** green. Rust test suite + production build green. No breaking changes — settings auto-default and your data migrates forward.

For previous release notes (v2.4.9, v2.4.8, v2.4.6, v2.4.5), see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

<details>
<summary>v2.4.9 — superseded</summary>

**Five bug fixes + two leonsk29 feature requests on top of v2.4.8.** All user-reported (GH levoy1 / kj103x Discord / nightmare13740 Discord / leonsk29 Discord + GH).

### What's fixed
- **ComfyUI Desktop App is detected and accepted in onboarding** (Bug U — levoy1 GH #47). Pre-v2.4.9 both auto-detect and manual path entry rejected the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ComfyUI` binary folder with "Invalid path — main.py not found". v2.4.9 walks a probe list when given a folder with `ComfyUI.exe` until it finds the actual Working Directory with `main.py`.
- **Chats with attached RAG documents persist across NSIS auto-update / WebView2 data reset** (Bug V/a — kj103x Discord 2026-05-23). Separate 30 s / `beforeunload` IndexedDB backup → `%APPDATA%\Locally Uncensored\rag_chunks_backup.json` restores chunks on cold start and on warm starts where IndexedDB is empty.
- **LU-spawned Ollama is killed when you quit LU** (Bug V/b — same kj103x report). `ollama serve` no longer lingers as a ~200 MB orphan after a tray-menu Quit. User-managed Ollama running pre-launch is still left alone.
- **Benchmark per-model display shows the latest session's tok/s, not a drifting historical average** (Bug W — nightmare13740 Discord 2026-05-23/24). New `getLatestSpeed` groups runs into sessions via a 10 s timestamp gap; leaderboard keeps the cross-model average.
- **Thinking + Agent toggles light up for community-uncensored Gemma 4 builds** (Bug X — leonsk29 Discord 2026-05-24). `normalizeFamily` rewritten as a greedy strip + suffix/quant peel + family-dash collapse `/g`, plus word-boundary contains-check.

### What's new
- **Onboarding suggests `nomic-embed-text` for Document Chat / RAG** (GH #45 — leonsk29). Auto-detects existing embedding models or offers a one-click 274 MB pull.
- **VRAM filter for text models in Discover** (GH #46 — leonsk29). Lightweight ≤10 GB / Mid-Range 10–16 GB / High-End >16 GB chips on the text tab.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v2.4.8 — superseded</summary>

**Hotfix: 8 fixes on top of v2.4.6.** All user-reported. v2.4.7 was tagged but not separately released; its six fixes ship together with v2.4.8.

### What's fixed
- **Text models in Discover keep their INSTALLED badge after restart** (Bug S — leonsk29 GH #43). Pre-v2.4.8 the badge only lit up if the download finished in the current session, so a model installed yesterday looked uninstalled today. v2.4.8 also matches against the provider model list (Ollama tags directly, plus GGUF downloads via `hf.co/<repo>:<quant>` references), so whatever Ollama / LM Studio actually have on disk is what the Discover grid shows.
- **`canPull:false` text models now get a clickable HuggingFace link** (Bug T — leonsk29 GH #44). Qwen 3.6 27B Samantha and GLM 5.1 754B MoE both have HF pages but no GGUF on day-one, so they show up as Available rather than downloadable. Before this they had no UI to open the HF page from inside LU. v2.4.8 adds the external-link button next to the Available badge.
- **LM Studio server-off banner is dismiss-able and matches the dropdown chrome** (Bug Q UX polish). The v2.4.7 banner that surfaces "Start LM Studio Server" in the model picker had amber styling that clashed with the rest of the dropdown. v2.4.8 switches to neutral white/gray and adds an X to dismiss. Dismiss sticks across dropdown re-opens within the same LU session but is not persisted, so the hint resurfaces on the next launch in case the user forgot to start the server.
- **Benchmark tok/s now matches actual chat throughput** (Bug M — nightmare13740 Discord). Pre-v2.4.7 the benchmark counted time-to-first-token + stream init in the tok/s denominator, so any local model looked slower in the Benchmark tab than in real chat. On nightmare13740's RTX 4070 Laptop 8 GB + gemma4:e4b: ollama CLI 30 tok/s, manual chat 23–25 tok/s, pre-fix benchmark 12 tok/s. v2.4.8 starts the clock at first-token-received and (for Ollama) prefers the server-reported `eval_count` / `eval_duration` from the final stream chunk, with a wall-clock fallback for OpenAI-compat providers when streaming gets buffered. End result: benchmark matches CLI / chat baselines on every provider.
- **Windows ComfyUI install probes `git --version` before clone** (Bug N — juliandiggins-stack GH #40). If a WSL / Linux-mounted git is first on PATH, the previous code let the clone start and die mid-flight with cryptic stderr. New tri-state probe (Native / NonNative / Missing) either proceeds silently, surfaces a clear "install Git for Windows" hint when missing, or logs a soft warning when a non-native git might still work.
- **Anthropic custom-proxy provider no longer double-prefixes `/v1`** (Bug O — 0yagizz Discord). Users pointing the Anthropic provider at a proxy (claude-relay-server, LiteLLM, opencode-zen) whose docs end the baseUrl with `/v1` got a silent 404 on `…/v1/v1/messages`. v2.4.8 collapses the duplicate.
- **Image / video generation timeouts now configurable in Settings** (Bug P — ake0n_official Discord). CPU-only / iGPU users finished sampling mid-run when the previous hard-coded 20-min image cap hit. v2.4.8 surfaces both image and video timeouts as numeric inputs (defaults stay 20 min / 60 min, range 1–480 min).
- **Chat model picker surfaces "Start LM Studio Server" inline when LM Studio is installed but its server is off** (Bug Q — wakeywakeynow GH #41). Symptom was "i am running lm studio but i can't choose any models i have installed!!!!" — root cause: LM Studio's HTTP server doesn't auto-start with the app, so the user has models on disk but the model picker silently dropped LM Studio. v2.4.8 detects the installed-but-off state and renders an inline banner in the picker with a working Start Server button; clicking it kicks off the LM Studio server via the existing `start_lmstudio_server` Tauri command and re-populates the model list without restarting LU.
- **Custom ComfyUI save nodes' outputs now surface in LU's gallery** (Bug R — silentrunningcaUSA GH Discussion #6). Pre-v2.4.8 LU only scraped `images` / `gifs` / `videos` from the history payload, missing every community workflow that uses a non-canonical save node (audio, custom metadata, CivitAI flows). v2.4.8 generic extractor accepts any keyed array of file-shaped objects.

### Stability
- `vitest`: **2306 tests** green.
- `cargo test --release`: **100 passed + 1 ignored** (incl. live `git_probe` host probe).
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean. `cargo check`: clean (pre-existing dead-code warnings only).
- No breaking changes, settings auto-migrate with safe defaults.

### Heads-up
v2.4.8 is a Windows + Linux release; macOS is not part of this build. `#bug-reports` / `#help-*` / GitHub will be monitored daily for regression reports.

Still investigating: OpenRouter half of 0yagizz's report (needs F12 console output to repro).

---

## Download

### Windows
Download the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases/latest):
- **`.exe`** — NSIS installer (recommended)
- **`.msi`** — Windows Installer

> **Other platforms:** The source code builds on Linux and macOS via `npm run tauri build`, but only Windows is officially tested and supported.

> **Plug & Play:** Just install and launch. The setup wizard auto-detects all 12 supported local backends ([Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), llama.cpp, LocalAI, Jan, GPT4All, text-generation-webui, TabbyAPI, Aphrodite, SGLang). Nothing installed yet? The wizard shows one-click install links for every backend.

> **Antivirus warning?** Some engines (ESET, Avast, Microsoft SmartScreen) flag the installer as suspicious — this is a **false positive** caused by heuristics on unsigned NSIS installers that download other binaries. The installer is built by GitHub Actions from public source on `master` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). The auto-update channel is signed against a public minisign key. Full context, verification steps, and one-click vendor submission links: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#antivirus--browser-false-positives).

## Quick Start

> **New to Locally Uncensored?** Read the [Getting Started Guide](https://locallyuncensored.com/guide/) with screenshots for every step.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
npm install
npm run dev
```

### For Contributors — Dev-Mode Setup

> ⚠️ **Just want to use the app?** Grab the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases/latest) (the `.exe` or `.msi` in the **Download** section above). That gives you the full Tauri desktop app with auto-update. The commands below start LU in **browser dev-mode** — fewer features, Vite proxy noise, meant for contributing to the codebase.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
setup.bat   # Windows — installs Node, Git, Ollama, then npm run dev
# setup.sh  # macOS / Linux equivalent
```

Launches at `http://localhost:5173` in your default browser.

### Image & Video Generation

Open the **Create** tab. ComfyUI is auto-detected or one-click installed. Models download with one click. Workflow is set to **Auto** — just write a prompt and hit Generate.
