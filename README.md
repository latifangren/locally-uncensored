## v2.4.3 — Current Release

**LM Studio plug-and-play overhaul + theme/UX polish.**

Drop-in upgrade from v2.4.2. Auto-update prompts on next launch.

This release closes the LM-Studio onboarding gap that several Discord users hit on a truly-fresh box, plus a handful of UI polish items reported during the same sweep.

### What's fixed
- **LM Studio onboarding works on a truly-fresh box** — pre-bootstrap `lms.exe` lookup at `…\Programs\LM Studio\resources\app\.webpack\lms.exe`, plus a two-pass GUI bootstrap dance that launches the GUI minimally and waits for `~/.lmstudio/` to populate when the first `lms bootstrap` doesn't. No more "open LM Studio once and come back" detour.
- **Skip download when LM Studio is already installed** — `install_lmstudio` short-circuits if it finds an existing install, so toggling the server on no longer triggers a 570 MB re-download.
- **Onboarding "LM Studio offline → start server" card** — when LM Studio is detected but the server isn't running, the Backends step shows a primary one-click button that starts it. The Ollama-install button hides in that branch.
- **Settings → AI Backends inline "Start Server" button** — same one-click pattern surfaces in Settings when LM Studio is expanded with the server down. Status dot flips red → green in ~8 s.
- **Actionable runtime hint** — when LM Studio replies "No LM Runtime found" the assistant message is rewritten as a 3-step "Open LM Studio → Discover → Runtimes → llama.cpp (CPU)" instead of the raw API error. Three vitest unit tests guard the detection (case-insensitive, no false-positive on other 400s).
- **Recommended starter card unblocked on first launch** — Models step's default sub-tab now derives from what's actually in the curated list, so the Qwen 2.5 0.5B starter shows up on a fresh install instead of an empty step.
- **Embedding-only models filtered from the picker** — LM Studio's default `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5` no longer counts as an "installed model" and no longer shows up in the chat picker.
- **Dark theme from frame 1** — `<html class="dark">` plus inline `#0a0a0a` body bg plus `useLayoutEffect` in AppShell. Onboarding theme step removed (light is still in Settings → General → Appearance). No more white flash on first paint.
- **Chat input scrollbar polish** — `.scrollbar-thin::-webkit-scrollbar-button` hidden across all permutations. Clean 6 px thumb, no XP-style up/down arrows.
- **HF model search no longer crashes the dropdown on repo-path queries** — `baseName` undefined ReferenceError fixed. Search is case-insensitive, and selecting a model that's no longer in the list resets the picker.

### Stability
- `vitest`: 2254 / 2254 green (+3 new unit tests for the LM-Studio runtime-missing rewrite)
- `cargo test`: 44 / 44 green
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean
- Live-verified each fix end-to-end on a wiped Test-VM (LM Studio + `~/.lmstudio` purged, LU AppData reset). End-to-end "pong!" reply confirmed via LM Studio + Qwen 2.5 0.5B (20/8.2k tokens).
- No breaking changes, no localStorage migration — upgrade in place.

### Heads-up — extra-active first week
Build environment for this one is different from usual. CI ships the same x64 + Linux installers as always, but to catch anything that slipped through the live-test pass: we'll be checking `#bug-reports` / `#help-*` / GitHub daily for the next ~5 days. If something behaves off after updating, please drop a note — fix turnaround should be fast (a v2.4.4 hotfix lands the same way auto-update did v2.4.3).

For older releases, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Download

### Windows
Download the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases/latest):
- **`.exe`** — NSIS installer (recommended)
- **`.msi`** — Windows Installer

> **Other platforms:** The source code builds on Linux and macOS via `npm run tauri build`, but only Windows is officially tested and supported.

> **Plug & Play:** Just install and launch. The setup wizard auto-detects all 12 supported local backends ([Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), llama.cpp, LocalAI, Jan, GPT4All, text-generation-webui, TabbyAPI, Aphrodite, SGLang). Nothing installed yet? The wizard shows one-click install links for every backend.

> **Antivirus warning?** Some engines (ESET, Avast, Microsoft SmartScreen) flag the installer as suspicious — this is a **false positive** caused by heuristics on unsigned NSIS installers that download other binaries. The installer is built by GitHub Actions from public source on `master` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). The auto-update channel is signed against a public minisign key. Full context, verification steps, and one-click vendor submission links: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#antivirus--browser-false-positives).

## Quick Start

> **New to Locally Uncensored?** Read the [Getting Started Guide](https://locallyuncensored.com/guide/) with screenshots for every step.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
npm install
npm run dev
```

### For Contributors — Dev-Mode Setup

> ⚠️ **Just want to use the app?** Grab the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases/latest) (the `.exe` or `.msi` in the **Download** section above). That gives you the full Tauri desktop app with auto-update. The commands below start LU in **browser dev-mode** — fewer features, Vite proxy noise, meant for contributing to the codebase.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
setup.bat   # Windows — installs Node, Git, Ollama, then npm run dev
# setup.sh  # macOS / Linux equivalent
```

Launches at `http://localhost:5173` in your default browser.

### Image & Video Generation

Open the **Create** tab. ComfyUI is auto-detected or one-click installed. Models download with one click. Workflow is set to **Auto** — just write a prompt and hit Generate.
