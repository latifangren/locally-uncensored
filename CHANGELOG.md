## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.8] - 2026-05-23

Drop-in hotfix on top of v2.4.6. v2.4.7 was tagged but not separately released, so v2.4.8 ships its six fixes alongside two new ones plus a UX polish: nine changes total since the last public release.

### Fixed — Model Manager

- **Text models in Discover keep their INSTALLED badge after restart** (Bug S — leonsk29 GH #43). Pre-v2.4.8 `isModelFullyInstalled` in `src/components/models/DiscoverModels.tsx` only consulted the in-memory `downloads` store, which is empty after a relaunch. A model installed yesterday looked uninstalled today. v2.4.8 also matches against the provider model list (`useModels().models`) for Ollama tags and for HuggingFace GGUF downloads pulled in via `hf.co/<repo>:<quant>` references, so whatever Ollama and LM Studio actually have on disk surfaces correctly. Session downloads remain a fast-path signal that doesn't wait for a `fetchModels()` round-trip.

- **`canPull:false` text models get a clickable HuggingFace link** (Bug T — leonsk29 GH #44). Curated entries that have a HF page but no GGUF on day-one (Qwen 3.6 27B Samantha, GLM 5.1 754B MoE) render with a green "Available" badge instead of a Download button. Before v2.4.8 there was no UI to open the linked HF page. v2.4.8 adds an external-link icon button next to the Available badge for those entries.

### Fixed — LM Studio server-off banner UX polish

- **Dismiss-able with neutral chrome** (Bug Q polish). The v2.4.7 LM Studio server-off banner in the model picker was painted amber/gold and clashed with the surrounding dropdown. v2.4.8 switches to neutral `bg-white/[0.03]` + `text-gray-300/200` and adds a small X in the top-right to dismiss. The dismiss flag lives at module-scope (not React state) so it survives the dropdown unmount/remount cycle inside one LU run, but is not persisted to localStorage — the hint reappears on the next launch if the user forgot to start the LM Studio server.

### Included from v2.4.7 (which never shipped as its own release)

All six v2.4.7 fixes ride along — see the [2.4.7] section below for full detail. Brief recap:

- **Bug M** — Benchmark tok/s now matches actual chat throughput. Ollama path prefers server-reported `eval_count` / `eval_duration`; OpenAI-compat falls back to wall-clock when streaming is buffered.
- **Bug N** — `install_comfyui` + `install_custom_node` probe `git --version` before clone and surface a "Install Git for Windows" hint when missing or non-native.
- **Bug O** — Anthropic provider's `messagesUrl()` collapses a trailing `/v1` so proxy users with `https://proxy.example/v1` baseUrl no longer get `…/v1/v1/messages`.
- **Bug P** — Image / video generation timeouts now configurable in Settings (defaults 20 min image / 60 min video, range 1–480 min).
- **Bug Q** — Chat model picker shows "Start LM Studio Server" banner when LM Studio is installed but its HTTP server is off.
- **Bug R** — Custom ComfyUI save nodes' outputs now surface in LU's gallery (generic extractor accepts any keyed array of file-shaped objects).

### Stability

- `vitest`: **2306 tests** green.
- `cargo test --release`: **100 passed + 1 ignored** (incl. live `git_probe_live_on_this_host`).
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean. `cargo check`: clean (pre-existing dead-code warnings only).
- No breaking changes, no localStorage migration — upgrade in place.

### Heads-up

v2.4.8 is a Windows + Linux release; macOS is not part of this build. `#bug-reports` / `#help-*` / GitHub will be monitored daily for regression reports.

Still investigating: OpenRouter half of 0yagizz's report (needs F12 console output to repro).

## [2.4.7] - 2026-05-22

Drop-in hotfix on top of v2.4.6. Five bugs: four user-reported (M — Discord nightmare13740; N — GH #40 juliandiggins-stack; O — Discord 0yagizz; P — Discord ake0n_official; R — GH Discussion #6 silentrunningcaUSA) plus internal hardening on the ComfyUI history-output extractor.

### Fixed — benchmark accuracy

- **Benchmark tok/s now excludes time-to-first-token + stream init** (Bug M — nightmare13740 Discord #help-chat, 2026-05-19). Pre-v2.4.7 `useBenchmark.runBenchmark` started the clock at `performance.now()` before opening the chat stream and used the resulting `totalTime` as the denominator for `tokensPerSec`. On any setup with non-trivial first-token latency (warm-up cost, connection init, ollama model load), the benchmark undercounted generation-phase throughput. nightmare13740's RTX 4070 Laptop 8 GB + gemma4:e4b reproduced the issue cleanly: ollama CLI baseline 30 tok/s, manual chat measurement 23–25 tok/s, pre-v2.4.7 benchmark 12 tok/s. v2.4.7 extracts `computeGenerationTps(tokenCount, totalTime, firstTokenTime)` into `src/stores/benchmarkStore.ts` as a pure helper, subtracts TTFT from the denominator, guards against `generationTime <= 0` for degenerate runs (0-token, 1-token, totalTime ≤ firstTokenTime). `useBenchmark.ts:55` now calls the helper; `timeToFirstToken` continues to surface as its own stat in the benchmark UI so users can compare TTFT and steady-state separately. Seven new vitest cases pin the math: nominal extraction, nightmare's exact 12-vs-24 tok/s reconstruction, zero-token guard, zero-generation-time guard, tiny TTFT relative to totalTime, single-token degenerate case.

  Late-shipping pre-release E2E in the actual release build (not vite-dev) found that the TTFT-subtraction formula alone was not enough. The Tauri Rust proxy (`proxy_localhost_stream`) collects bytes before returning, and WebView2 release-mode also aggregates TCP chunks for short responses. The result: for fast small models, all NDJSON lines arrive in JS within a single millisecond — `firstTokenTime ≈ totalTime`, `generationTimeMs ≈ 0`, formula returns numbers like 685,000 tok/s. To make the fix real for release builds, the Ollama provider now extracts the authoritative `eval_count` (tokens) and `eval_duration` (ns) fields from the server's final `done:true` chunk and forwards them via two new optional fields on `ChatStreamChunk` (`evalCount`, `evalDurationMs`). `useBenchmark` prefers these over JS timing whenever they're set: post-fix Ollama benchmark on this host now shows qwen2.5:0.5b at ~245 tok/s (matches Ollama API baseline 241.5) instead of 685,000. For providers that don't return server-side metrics (LM Studio / OpenAI-compat / vLLM / Anthropic), a sanity fallback kicks in: when `generationTimeMs < 100` and no API metrics, the formula falls back to wall-clock rate (`tokens / totalTime * 1000`) so the displayed number stays sane rather than blowing up to six-figure values. LM Studio q4_k_m benchmark on this host shows 85–136 tok/s via this path (vs the previous absurd readouts).

### Fixed — Windows / ComfyUI install

- **`install_comfyui` + `install_custom_node` now probe `git --version` before clone** (Bug N — juliandiggins-stack GH issue #40, 2026-05-18). The existing spawn-error guard catches a flat "git not on PATH" failure, but it can't tell when a WSL / Linux-mounted git binary is first on PATH on a Windows machine — `git --version` succeeds, the clone *starts*, then dies because the Linux binary can't handle Windows-style target paths. The user ends up with a half-cloned ComfyUI directory and no actionable hint. v2.4.7 adds a tri-state `WindowsGitState` probe (Native / NonNative / Missing) in `src-tauri/src/commands/install.rs`. Native (`git version 2.x.x.windows.y` tag) proceeds silently. Missing blocks the install with a clear "install Git for Windows from https://git-scm.com/download/win and restart LU" hint. NonNative (no `.windows` tag — MSYS git, Cygwin git, or a WSL binary mounted into Windows PATH) surfaces a soft warning into the install panel logs but proceeds, since many MSYS/Cygwin gits actually handle Windows paths fine. Eleven new cargo unit tests pin the classification matrix (Git for Windows, WSL git, MSYS git, broken install, empty stdout, garbage stdout, case-insensitive) plus the install-hint copy (must mention `git-scm.com/download/win`, must mention PATH ordering for the WSL case).

### Fixed — Anthropic custom-proxy provider

- **Anthropic provider no longer double-prefixes `/v1` when the user's baseUrl already ends in `/v1`** (Bug O — 0yagizz Discord 2026-05-18). Pre-v2.4.7 the provider unconditionally appended `/v1/messages` to the configured baseUrl. Users pointing the Anthropic provider at a proxy (claude-relay-server, LiteLLM, opencode-zen) sometimes paste a baseUrl with `/v1` already in the path — the proxy operator pinned the API version in their docs — and got back a silent 404 on `https://proxy.example/v1/v1/messages`. v2.4.7 collapses the second `/v1` via a new `messagesUrl()` helper that drops a trailing `/v1` before appending `/messages`. The default `https://api.anthropic.com` shape still produces the canonical `/v1/messages`, and `https://proxy.example/api-v1` (different non-suffix path that happens to contain "v1") still gets the standard `/v1/messages` append. Five new vitest cases cover both proxy shapes, trailing-slash tolerance, the default Anthropic URL, and the defensive non-suffix-`v1` case. OpenRouter half of 0yagizz's original report is still under investigation pending more F12-console context from the reporter — that path lands in v2.4.8 if it turns out to need a code change rather than a config one.

### Fixed — LM Studio model picker

- **Chat model picker now surfaces a "Start LM Studio Server" hint when LM Studio is installed but its server is off** (Bug Q — wakeywakeynow GH #41, 2026-05-19). Symptom: user has LM Studio installed with models on disk, opens LU's model picker, sees only Ollama models, no clue that LM Studio is missing because its server stopped. Root cause is straightforward: LM Studio's HTTP server doesn't auto-start with the app — the user has to run `lms server start` or click Developer → Start Server in the LM Studio UI. With the server off, LU's openai-compat probe gets no models and silently drops the LM Studio backend from the picker. v2.4.4 added the same hint to onboarding, but onboarding only runs once on first launch — returning users hit a stopped server with no visible signal. v2.4.7 wires the existing `lmstudio_server_status` Tauri command into `ModelSelector`'s dropdown and renders an inline banner with a working "Start LM Studio Server" button when `(lms_present || models_detected) && !running`. The button calls the existing `start_lmstudio_server` Tauri command, polls status for up to ~6 s for the server to bind 1234, then triggers a fresh `fetchModels()` so the LM Studio models appear in the dropdown without an LU restart. Live E2E in release build: with LM Studio server stopped, picker shows the banner with the right on-disk model count ("5 models on disk"). Clicking the button starts the server, the banner replaces itself with the LM Studio models, no app restart required.

### Fixed — image / video timeouts

- **Image and video generation timeouts are now user-configurable** (Bug P — ake0n_official Discord #help-chat, 2026-05-19). Pre-v2.4.7 image gens timed out at a hard-coded 20 min and video at 60 min. That was a sane default for desktop NVIDIA hardware but actively painful for the CPU-only / iGPU edge: ake0n_official's 12th-gen Intel Core + Intel UHD Graphics (128 MB allotment) finished sampling step 9 of 25 on a 1024 px Juggernaut-XL run before the 20-minute cap killed the job mid-sampler, with no way to recover the partial work. v2.4.7 adds `imageGenTimeoutMinutes` and `videoGenTimeoutMinutes` to `types/settings.ts` with defaults 20 and 60 (matching pre-v2.4.7 behavior on fresh installs and via the persisted-store migration), reads them in `useCreate.generate()` with a `Math.max(1, …)` clamp to prevent footguns from a 0-min input, and surfaces both as numeric inputs in `SettingsPage`'s new "Image / Video Generation Timeouts" section with an explanatory blurb naming the iGPU / CPU-only use case directly. Users on slow hardware can now bump both caps as needed (range 1–480 min); fast-GPU users see no change.

  Two release-mode polish items found during pre-ship E2E and folded into the same ship: (1) the inputs now use `value={settings.imageGenTimeoutMinutes ?? 20}` (and `?? 60` for video) so existing v2.4.6 users — whose persisted settings store predates these fields — see the defaults rendered as the field value instead of an empty input. Functionally `useCreate.generate()` already fell back to the defaults via `Math.max(1, settings.imageGenTimeoutMinutes || 20)`, so this is a UX-only patch; the saved timeout was always correct, just invisible on the first Settings visit after upgrade. (2) The `onChange` handler now clamps the upper bound too — `Math.min(480, Math.max(1, …))` — matching the HTML `max=480` attribute that was previously only a browser hint. Typing 999 used to persist as 999; v2.4.7 caps it at 480, so users who blindly type a large number to "disable" the timeout cap at the documented range instead.

### Fixed — ComfyUI output extraction

- **Custom save nodes' outputs now surface in LU's gallery** (Bug R — silentrunningcaUSA GH Discussion #6, 2026-05-20). Pre-v2.4.7 `useCreate.ts` only scraped `nodeOutput.images`, `nodeOutput.gifs`, and `nodeOutput.videos` from each entry in ComfyUI's `/history/{promptId}` payload. That worked for the canonical SaveImage / SaveAnimatedWEBP / VHS_VideoCombine nodes, but every community workflow that uses a non-canonical save node — SaveImageWithMetadata posts under `result`, audio save nodes under `audio`, plenty of CivitAI workflows define their own keys — dropped its file on disk in ComfyUI's `output/` folder and never made it into LU's gallery. silentrunningcaUSA's symptom was exactly that: "I can send a generation request to ComfyUI and I can see the output in ComfyUI itself, but the result never comes back to LU." v2.4.7 extracts the extraction logic into a generic helper `extractComfyOutputFiles(nodeOutput)` in `src/api/comfyui.ts` that scans every key on the node output, accepts any array whose entries have a string `filename`, and fills in safe defaults for `subfolder` (`''`) and `type` (`'output'`) so downstream URL construction still works when a custom node omits them. Wired into all three `useCreate.ts` history-poll sites (WebSocket-branch heartbeat poll, WebSocket-branch completion path, polling-only fallback) so the fix applies regardless of which transport ComfyUI is on. Ten new vitest cases pin canonical-keys, custom-keys, audio, multi-key-on-same-node, missing-subfolder-and-type defaults, non-array values (LATENT, metadata, scalars), invalid array entries (missing filename, non-string filename, null), and the empty/null/undefined input guard.

### Tests

- `vitest`: **2306 passed** (previously 2284, +22 across the v2.4.7 bug fixes — +7 benchmark TPS math in `stores/__tests__/benchmarkStore.test.ts`, +5 Anthropic messages-URL in `api/__tests__/provider-anthropic.test.ts`, +10 ComfyUI output extraction in `api/__tests__/comfyui-models.test.ts`).
- `cargo test --release --bins`: **100 passed + 1 ignored** (previously 89, +11 for `WindowsGitState` classification + install-hint copy in `commands/install.rs`).
- `cargo check --release`: clean (pre-existing dead-code warnings only).
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean.

### Deferred to v2.4.8

- **Bug Q** — wakeywakeynow GH #41 ("LM Studio installed but can't choose any models, worked first time, broken today"). Most plausible root cause is the LM Studio server having been stopped between the two runs (LM Studio closes its server when the desktop app is quit). The "no models — start LM Studio server" hint added in v2.4.4 already surfaces this state, so before landing a code change we want the reporter's F12 console output to confirm whether `listModels()` is timing out, returning empty, or failing auth. Carried into v2.4.8's outreach-then-fix queue rather than guessing at a fix that could regress the path that already works for everyone else.

## [2.4.6] - 2026-05-19

Drop-in hotfix on top of v2.4.5. **One bug**: nightmare13740 (Discord 2026-05-18).

### Fixed — chat throughput on tight VRAM cards

- **Dropped hardcoded `num_gpu: 99` override on every Ollama chat request** (Bug L — nightmare13740 Discord #help-chat, 2026-05-18). The override was added in v2.2.1 (commit `ead5673`, april 2026) on the assumption "all desktop users have 16 GB+ cards, Ollama's auto-detect is too conservative, force max GPU offload." That assumption no longer holds with 2026 laptop GPUs (RTX 4070 Laptop ships with 8 GB) and modern model context windows (Gemma 3/4 advertise 128k native context, which materially expands the KV cache footprint). Symptom on nightmare13740's RTX 4070 Laptop 8 GB + gemma3:4b: ollama CLI without `num_gpu` ran at **30 tok/s** with sane VRAM use; LU's chat hit **6.9 tok/s** with VRAM saturated and 4 GB spilled to system RAM. The forced 99-layer offload exhausted VRAM, the KV cache had nowhere to live except system RAM, and every generated token thrashed across the PCIe bus. v2.4.6 removes the override from all five chat sites — `chatStream`, `chatStreamWithTools`, and `chatWithTools` in `src/api/ollama.ts`, `chatStream` and `chatWithTools` in `src/api/providers/ollama-provider.ts`, the Agent-Mode tool-call body in `src/lib/ollama-stream-tools.ts`, and both Remote-Access JS-template paths (`nativeToolChat` and the main agent loop) in `src-tauri/src/commands/remote.rs`. Ollama now applies its own VRAM-aware layer-placement logic on every request, which is a no-op on cards with headroom (Ollama already maxes layer count when VRAM allows) and restores CLI parity on tight cards.

### Tests

- `vitest`: **2284 passed** (93 files, unchanged count). Rewrote one existing assertion in `provider-ollama.test.ts` ("always includes options with num_gpu" → "v2.4.6 Bug L: NEVER sets num_gpu — Ollama decides layer placement itself") and two assertions in `mobile-parity.test.ts` to lock down the absence of `num_gpu` in the request body.
- `cargo test --release`: **89 passed + 1 ignored** — no Rust unit-test changes (the Rust edits were in JS templates that aren't unit-tested at the Rust layer).
- `cargo check --release`: clean (pre-existing dead-code warnings only).

## [2.4.5] - 2026-05-17

Drop-in hotfix on top of v2.4.4. **Fourteen bugs total**: six user-reported (A — Discord/Reddit; B — GH #38; C — GH Discussion #39; D — Discord; E — GH #32 comment; K — Discord #help-coding-agent) plus eight surfaced during the real-tester Arch live verification sweep (F — `install_custom_node` not venv-aware on PEP 668; G — `install_ollama` Windows-only `.exe` download, plus a refix when the original tarball URL stopped resolving; H — `install_lmstudio` Windows-only; I — `install_python` Windows-only winget; J — `start_comfyui` crashes on non-NVIDIA systems without `--cpu` flag).

### Fixed — image / video creation
- **Video output now actually produces `.mp4` files** (Bug A — miguelkodoatie Discord 14.05., Turbulent_Tomato7559 Reddit 10.05.). v2.4.4 added a warning when ComfyUI lacked `VHS_VideoCombine`, but the fallback to `SaveAnimatedWEBP` still produced an animated `.webp` "image" instead of a video. v2.4.5 turns the warning into a blocking modal with three options: install VHS now (one-click git clone + pip + ComfyUI restart, ~30 s), continue with `.webp`, or cancel. New entry `videohelpersuite` added to `CUSTOM_NODE_REGISTRY` in `src/api/discover.ts`, new `VhsInstallModal` component in `CreateView`, and a Promise-resolver bridge in `createStore.vhsInstallPrompt` so `useCreate.generate()` can await the user's choice. The install path re-builds the workflow after ComfyUI comes back, so the user gets a proper MP4 on the same Generate click instead of having to retry.

### Fixed — onboarding / startup
- **"ComfyUI loading..." now surfaces actionable UI after 60 s** (Bug B — dethlux GH #38). The previous indefinite spinner gave no diagnosis when ComfyUI's process was alive but its web server never responded (CUDA OOM, missing wheels, custom-node import crash). After a 60 s grace period, the banner now shows the elapsed time, an inline log viewer (last 30 lines of `comfyui_status.logs`), a "Kill process" button (calls existing `stop_comfyui` Tauri command), and the existing Restart button — so the user can either fix it from the logs or recover without restarting LU.

### Fixed — chat / Ollama
- **One-click repair for "unable to load model: …blobs/sha256-…" errors** (Bug C — Anson192 GH Discussion #39, RTX 4090). Ollama returns HTTP 500 with that error string when the model's manifest references a blob that isn't on disk (manual deletion, external drive offline at pull time, filesystem corruption). v2.4.5 adds a new `OllamaErrorKind = 'missing-blob'` classification in `src/lib/ollama-errors.ts` with a regex matching `unable to load model[:\s].*blobs[\\/]+sha256-[0-9a-f]+`. The error string carries only the blob hash, so `parseOllamaError` accepts an optional `fallbackModel` argument that `loadModel`, `OllamaProvider.chatStream`, and `OllamaProvider.chatWithTools` now pass through. `Header.tsx` treats missing-blob the same way as stale-manifest — the Lichtschalter's existing one-click "Refresh" button now also repairs missing-blob via `ollama pull <name>`.

### Fixed — context window detection
- **Dynamic context-window detection for LM Studio + Ollama** (Bug K — phantomderp Discord #help-coding-agent, 2026-05-04). Pre-fix LU cached an 8k fallback for unknown OpenAI-compatible models and never asked the server what the model actually supports, so the header showed 8k and the settings slider capped there even when the model could do 32k or 128k. `OpenAIProvider.getContextLength` now cascades: (1) `KNOWN_CONTEXT` table (expanded from 9 to 24 entries: gpt-5, o1/o3, deepseek-r1, llama-3.3, Groq + OpenRouter aliases), (2) `probeContextFromServer` for local backends — first the LM Studio Enhanced API `/api/v0/models/<id>` which returns `max_context_length` + `loaded_context_length` directly, then the generic `/v1/models/<id>` returning `context_window` / `max_model_len` / `n_ctx_train` on vLLM, llama.cpp server, others, (3) `guessContextFromName` heuristic for unknown families (llama-3.x → 131072, qwen2.5 → 32768, deepseek-r1 → 64000, etc.), (4) 8k hard fallback only if all three fail. `listModels` enriches contextLength in parallel via `Promise.all` so dropdowns surface real max context immediately. Cloud URLs skip the probe (no N+1, latency cost not warranted). `OllamaProvider.getContextLength` replaces the single `general.context_length` check with the same cascade pattern: tries `model_info["general.context_length"]` first, then any key ending in `.context_length` (Ollama leaves `general.context_length` empty for qwen2.5 and llama3.x and uses architecture-specific keys like `qwen2.context_length`, `llama.context_length`), then `parameters.num_ctx` (object or Modelfile-style string), then 4096 fallback. +13 new vitest cases (7 OpenAI + 4 Ollama + 3 heuristic + 1 fragile-test rewrite). Live verified on Arch + Host with multiple LM Studio + Ollama models.

### Fixed — Linux / AppImage
- **Arch / Wayland AppImage now actually paints content** (Bug D — emilmjt Discord 11.05.). The "empty window" symptom on Arch is Tauri 2 + webkit2gtk-4.1 silently failing on DMABUF buffer-sharing and DMA-compositing paths on certain Mesa versions (tauri-apps/tauri#9304). `src-tauri/src/main.rs` now sets `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` and `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` at startup on Linux, falling back to software composite — same workaround the GNOME and KDE maintainers recommend. Only set when the user hasn't already exported the vars themselves. `tauri.conf.json` also now declares explicit `bundle.linux.deb.depends` and `bundle.linux.rpm.depends` for `webkit2gtk-4.1`, `gtk3`, and `libayatana-appindicator3-1`, and enables `bundleMediaFramework` on AppImage so gstreamer plugins ship inside the AppImage instead of relying on the host distribution.

### Fixed — Linux / ComfyUI runtime
- **`start_comfyui` + `auto_start_comfyui` pass `--cpu` on non-NVIDIA systems** (Bug J — discovered during 2026-05-17 Arch real-tester sweep). ComfyUI 0.21.x's `main.py` calls `get_torch_device()` → `torch.cuda.current_device()` unconditionally during import. On every Linux system without an NVIDIA driver (AMD ROCm setups, Intel Arc, pure CPU boxes, any user who hasn't installed `nvidia` yet), `torch.cuda._lazy_init()` raises `RuntimeError: Found no NVIDIA driver on your system` and `main.py` crashes before binding port 8188. The user then sees LU stuck on "ComfyUI loading…" (Bug B's 60-s panel surfaces this correctly, but the underlying spawn-then-crash burns time on every restart). New helper `process::needs_cpu_fallback()` probes `nvidia-smi`; when it's absent (and we're not on macOS, where PyTorch uses MPS and never touches cuda APIs), both ComfyUI spawn paths append `--cpu` to the argv. Live-verified on Arch VirtualBox VM 2026-05-17: pre-fix, `main.py` crashed with the verbatim `Found no NVIDIA driver` traceback; post-fix, ComfyUI 0.21.1 started cleanly in CPU mode and answered `/system_stats` after 15 s. Note: AMD/Intel users CURRENTLY downgrade to CPU too — a follow-up will probe `rocm-smi` and Intel XPU devices to pick the right backend, but the safe default is "no crash."

### Fixed — Linux / Ollama install
- **`install_ollama` now has a proper Linux path** (Bug G — discovered during 2026-05-17 Arch real-tester sweep, then refixed when live testing caught a broken tarball URL the same evening). Pre-fix: `install_ollama` unconditionally downloaded `https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe` (a Windows NSIS installer) and tried to execute it with `/S`. On Linux that fails with `Exec format error`; on macOS with the same binary-format mismatch. The user got a cryptic install failure with no actionable path. v2.4.5 dispatches by `target_os`: Windows keeps the existing NSIS flow; **macOS** surfaces a clear pointer at https://ollama.com/download/mac (auto-installing a code-signed `.app` past Gatekeeper from a Tauri process is brittle); **Linux** uses a distro-package hint path. The original v2.4.5 fix tried to download `https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases/latest/download/ollama-linux-amd64` from GitHub releases, but live testing on a real Arch VM caught that this URL stopped resolving in late 2025 — Ollama removed the raw amd64 binary asset and now ships `ollama-linux-amd64.tar.zst`, a 2–3 GB tarball with bundled CUDA libs that is too large for a click-to-install button. The refix instead checks if `ollama` is already on `$PATH` (e.g. via `pacman -S ollama` on Arch) and if so spawns `ollama serve` directly + waits for the API; otherwise it surfaces a distro-specific install command via the new `linux_ollama_install_hint(os_release)` helper that parses `/etc/os-release` ID + ID_LIKE tokens and routes to: `sudo pacman -S ollama` (Arch family), `sudo apt install ollama` for Debian 12+ / Ubuntu 23.10+ or `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh` (Debian family), `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh` (RHEL family), `sudo zypper install ollama` Tumbleweed or install.sh (SUSE family), install.sh or manual download (unknown). Both `install_ollama` and `wait_for_ollama_ready()` reuse the existing startup probe. 8 new cargo unit tests cover the full distro matrix.

### Fixed — Linux + macOS / LM Studio install
- **`install_lmstudio` no longer tries to run a Windows installer on Linux + macOS** (Bug H — discovered during 2026-05-17 Arch real-tester sweep). Pre-fix: `install_lmstudio` unconditionally downloaded `LMStudioSetup.exe` and tried `/S`. Same `Exec format error` on Linux + macOS as Bug G. LM Studio's Linux distribution is an AppImage whose URL rotates with every release (no stable string to mirror) and macOS distributes a code-signed `.app`. v2.4.5 surfaces a clear download pointer at `https://lmstudio.ai/download` for both non-Windows platforms with platform-specific install instructions (AppImage `chmod +x` for Linux, drag to `/Applications` for macOS). Windows path unchanged.

### Fixed — Linux + macOS / Python install
- **`install_python` no longer invokes Windows-only `winget` on Linux + macOS** (Bug I — discovered during 2026-05-17 Arch real-tester sweep). Pre-fix: `install_python` unconditionally called `Command::new("winget")` which on Linux/macOS fails with `winget: command not found`. In practice Python is virtually always pre-installed on Linux (base group on Arch, default on Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora) so the button rarely fires, but the failure path is unhelpful when it does. v2.4.5 detects the distro family from `/etc/os-release` (parses `ID` + `ID_LIKE` tokens correctly across quoted multi-value formats) and surfaces a distro-specific install command: `sudo pacman -S python python-pip` for Arch/Manjaro/EndeavourOS/Garuda; `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv` for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/Pop!/elementary; `sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip` for Fedora/RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/AlmaLinux; `sudo zypper install python3 python3-pip` for openSUSE/SLES. macOS suggests `brew install python` or python.org. Generic fallback for unknown distros points at "your distro's package manager." Tested via 9 cargo unit tests covering the full distro matrix including quoted-multi-value `ID_LIKE="rhel centos fedora"` format that Rocky uses.

### Fixed — Linux / custom-node install
- **`install_custom_node` now uses the ComfyUI venv when present** (Bug F — discovered during Arch live verification 2026-05-17). The `install_custom_node` Tauri command (used by Bug A's VHS install path among others) used to call pip against `state.python_bin` (the system Python). On Arch and other PEP 668 distros the requirements install would silently fail with `error: externally-managed-environment` — and since the function did `let _ = pip.output()` and ignored the exit code, the user got a "installed" status while the requirements never actually landed. The next workflow build then crashed with `ModuleNotFoundError`. `install_custom_node` now (1) resolves `<ComfyUI>/venv` via the shared `resolve_comfyui_venv_python()` helper from `src-tauri/src/python.rs`, falling back to `state.python_bin` only when no venv exists, and (2) captures pip's exit status + stderr and runs them through `diagnose_pip_error` so PEP 668 / connection / disk-full / etc. surface actionable messages. This bug only fired on PEP 668 distros (Arch / Debian 12+ / Fedora 38+ / Ubuntu 23.04+) when the user installed ComfyUI through LU's installer (which creates the venv) and then tried to install any custom node afterwards. **LIVE-VERIFIED on REAL Arch 2026-05-17**: in the installed-Arch VM, simulated Bug E's outcome by creating `<ComfyUI>/venv`, then ran the EXACT pip flow `install_custom_node` would issue. (a) venv-python path: `requests>=2.0` installed cleanly into the venv's site-packages, `python -c "import requests; print(requests.__version__)"` returned `2.34.2`; (b) system-python path (what the pre-fix code would have done): pip exited with `error: externally-managed-environment` + Arch's verbatim "If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider … See PEP 668 for the detailed specification" message. Both legs proven empirically.

### Fixed — Linux / ComfyUI install
- **PEP 668 protected Pythons (Arch, Debian 12+, Fedora 38+, Ubuntu 23.04+) no longer brick the ComfyUI install** (Bug E — rzgrozt GH #32 comment 2026-05-08). A bare `python -m pip install torch ...` exits with `error: externally-managed-environment` on those distros because the stdlib carries an `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` marker file. v2.4.5 detects the marker via `sysconfig.get_path('stdlib')`, then runs `python -m venv <ComfyUI>/venv` and uses the venv's Python for every subsequent pip step. New helpers `is_pep668_protected`, `create_comfyui_venv`, and `venv_python_path` live in `src-tauri/src/commands/install.rs` and `src-tauri/src/python.rs`. `process.rs::start_comfyui` and `auto_start_comfyui` mirror the lookup so ComfyUI launches with the venv Python it was installed against — no `ModuleNotFoundError: torch` on first run. When the system Python's `venv` module is missing (some minimal Arch installs), the error now surfaces a one-line fix: `sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv` (or `apt install python3-venv` / `dnf install python3-virtualenv`). `diagnose_pip_error` also catches the externally-managed string directly as a fallback for anyone whose Python somehow bypasses the venv path.

### Tests
- `vitest`: **2284 passed** (93 files) — +7 for `parseOllamaError` missing-blob coverage in `src/lib/__tests__/ollama-errors.test.ts` (Anson192 verbatim error, generic no-fallback-model, forward+back-slash tolerance, Rust-proxy wrapping, chat-style message wording with + without model), +1 smoke test for the new `videohelpersuite` `CUSTOM_NODE_REGISTRY` entry, +13 for Bug K context-window detection across `provider-openai.test.ts` (LM Studio Enhanced API probe, generic `/v1/models/<id>` fallback, heuristic cascade, no-probe for cloud, listModels enrichment) and `provider-ollama.test.ts` (architecture-specific key cascade), +1 fragile 401 test rewrite.
- `cargo test --release`: **89 passed + 1 ignored** — +5 for Bug D (webkit env-var workarounds) + 13 for Bug E (PEP 668 detection, venv path layout, diagnose hints) + 9 for Bug I (`linux_python_install_hint` distro matrix: Arch, Manjaro via `ID_LIKE`, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Rocky via quoted `ID_LIKE="rhel centos fedora"`, openSUSE, unknown fallback, empty input) + 2 for Bug J (`needs_cpu_fallback` macOS short-circuit + determinism) + 8 for Bug G refix (`linux_ollama_install_hint` matching the same distro matrix). Bug D + Bug F + Bug H code-paths cross-platform via cfg gates. Bug E has a `#[ignore]`'d live integration test (`pep668_e2e_live_detect_and_create_venv`) driven against real Arch's `/usr/bin/python` during the 2026-05-17 verification.
- `cargo check --release`: clean (1 dead-code warning on unused `save_binary_file_dialog`, pre-existing).
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean.

### Verification — HARDCORE LIVE E2E (Windows 10 + RTX 3060 Ti + ComfyUI 0.12.0 via Computer-Use)
- **Bug A**: Modal "Install MP4 support?" appears on Generate when `VHS_VideoCombine` missing. **Full install path live-verified** end-to-end: git clone of Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite into `custom_nodes/`, pip install (opencv-python + imageio-ffmpeg), ComfyUI stop+start, reconnect-poll, workflow rebuild, actual Wan-video sampling phase started ("Loading text encoder... 2s"). Cancel path also verified (modal closes cleanly, returns to "Ready to generate").
- **Bug B**: Suspended ComfyUI via `NtSuspendProcess` while user navigates back to Create tab → triggers `useEffect` re-mount, `pollStatus` re-starts, detects ComfyUI down. Live-verified entire UI sequence: (1) "ComfyUI loading (12s)" elapsed-counter banner, (2) switch to actionable "ComfyUI is taking unusually long (86s)" panel after 60s threshold, (3) failure-mode explanation text rendered, (4) "View logs" toggle works (button label flips to "Hide logs"), (5) empty-logs fallback message renders ("No startup logs captured yet — ComfyUI hasn't emitted anything to stdout."), (6) "Kill process" button actually kills the spawned ComfyUI process (verified via PID gone + port 8188 free), (7) state machine transitions cleanly to "ComfyUI not responding" with Retry, (8) Retry click respawns ComfyUI which comes back online.
- **Bug C**: Disabled the qwen2.5:0.5b blob (`sha256-c5396e...`) → triggered LU's startup health scan → banner "Ollama 0.20.7 broke 1 of your model. qwen2.5:0.5b" appeared + inline "stale — refresh? ↻ Refresh" chip next to Lichtschalter. Clicked "Refresh all" → `pullModel` triggered → DownloadBadge showed completion within seconds. Note: Ollama 0.20.7 transforms ALL blob errors (missing OR 0-byte corrupted) into the `"X does not support generate"` pattern, so the new `missing-blob` regex primarily protects users on older Ollama versions (Anson192's exact scenario on RTX 4090). Both error paths route to the same one-click repair UX.
- **Bug D**: Linux webkit env-var function unit-tested cross-platform via 5 cargo tests (sets-both-when-unset, preserves user DMABUF override, preserves user COMPOSITING override, preserves empty-string as explicit unset, idempotent). **LIVE-VERIFIED on REAL Arch Linux + Wayland 2026-05-17**: installed Arch (kernel 7.0.8) in a VirtualBox VM, booted into a headless `sway` session (WLR_BACKENDS=headless, WLR_RENDERER=pixman, WLR_HEADLESS_OUTPUTS=1), built the LU release binary on the guest (`cargo build --release`, 7m 01s), and ran it twice: (a) defaults — `apply_linux_webkit_workarounds()` auto-sets `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` + `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1`, LU survives + window opens; (b) user override — `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=0 WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=0`, fix respects the override (still works on this particular Mesa setup, would crash on emilmjt-style broken DMABUF stacks). `grim` screenshots captured the actual LU onboarding screen ("Locally Uncensored", "Private, local AI chat. No servers, no tracking, everything stays on your machine.", "Get Started" button, 5-dot pagination) at 1280x800, **742 unique pixel colors** — definitive proof the window is no longer an empty black rectangle. Screenshots at `LU-E2E-Test-Kit/scripts/arch_live_e2e_screenshots/bugd-scenario1-fix-active.png` + `…-bypassed.png`.
- **Bug E**: PEP 668 detection + venv creation unit-tested cross-platform via 13 cargo tests across `install.rs::tests` and `python.rs::tests`. Path-layout tests cover both Windows (`venv/Scripts/python.exe`) and Unix (`venv/bin/python`) layouts. Resolver tests use real tempdirs to verify the `Some(path)` vs `None` gating. Diagnose tests cover Arch's exact `error: externally-managed-environment` string from rzgrozt's report plus the shorter `error: externally-managed` variant and confirm the suggested distro-install commands (`pacman -S python-virtualenv`, `apt install python3-venv`, `dnf install python3-virtualenv`) appear in the user-facing hint. **Plus a HARDCORE LIVE E2E test (`pep668_e2e_live_detect_and_create_venv`, `#[ignore]`'d so it runs on demand) drives the full flow against a real Python install whose stdlib has a real `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` marker file. The test verifies: (1) `is_pep668_protected` returns true against the marker-planted Python, (2) `create_comfyui_venv` succeeds and produces the venv-Python at `<ComfyUI>/venv/{Scripts|bin}/python(.exe)`, (3) the nested venv's pip runs without inheriting the PEP 668 block (the whole point of the fix), (4) a second `create_comfyui_venv` call is idempotent. Setup + run scripted in `LU-E2E-Test-Kit/scripts/pep668_live_test.ps1`: robocopies the system Python to a writable temp dir, plants the marker in the copy's stdlib (NOT the real system Python — that would wedge every pip on the box), runs cargo with `LU_PEP668_TEST_PYTHON` set, cleans up. Result: all 4 phases passed against Python 3.11.7 + planted marker on 2026-05-17.** **AND — on top of the Windows simulation — Bug E was ALSO live-verified against a REAL Arch Linux ISO booted in a VirtualBox VM on 2026-05-17. The Arch live ISO ships Python 3.14.4 with the actual `/usr/lib/python3.14/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` marker (multiline Arch text mentioning `pacman -S python-xyz`, identical to what rzgrozt's installer saw). Seven assertions all passed against this real environment: detection logic returns `YES`, `python -m venv` succeeds, venv Python lands at `/tmp/foo/venv/bin/python` (matching the Unix branch of `venv_python_path`), pip inside the venv is unblocked (downloads requests metadata without `externally-managed` error), idempotency holds, and the Rust-side equivalence of the shell probe matches verbatim. See `LU-E2E-Test-Kit/scripts/arch_live_e2e.md` for the full transcript. This live test also uncovered Bug F (separate fix above).**

## [2.4.4] - 2026-05-11

Hotfix sweep covering the v2.4.3 follow-up reports collected on Discord, Reddit, and GitHub Discussions between 2026-05-04 and 2026-05-11. Eight fixes total — six tied to specific Discord/Reddit reporters, one Reddit issue, and one GitHub Discussion (vokurta — RTX 6000 Blackwell, posted the same morning this sweep landed).

### Fixed — onboarding (LM Studio + ComfyUI)
- **LM Studio system-wide install path now detected** (Bug #2 — techx69, Discord 06.05.). `lmstudio_lms_path()` previously only looked under `~/.lmstudio/bin/`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\LM Studio\` and `where lms`, so a "for all users" install in `C:\Program Files\LM Studio\` came back as `lms_present: false`. New lookup walks `%PROGRAMFILES%`, `%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%`, `%PROGRAMW6432%`, plus a Windows registry sweep of `Uninstall\…\InstallLocation` for any subkey whose DisplayName starts with "LM Studio". (`winreg = "0.55"` added to `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]`.)
- **LM Studio models-on-disk soft-detect.** `lmstudio_server_status` now returns `models_detected` + `model_count` from a bounded walk of `~/.lmstudio/models/` for GGUF files. The onboarding "No local backend detected" branch now flips into the "LM Studio detected" CTA whenever either `lms_present && !running` OR `models_detected && !running` is true — so users with GGUFs but no resolved `lms.exe` (techx69's exact shape) get "LM Studio is installed (N models detected) but its server isn't currently running" instead of being pushed into a 570 MB re-install.
- **Multi-ComfyUI disambiguation in the onboarding ComfyUI step** (Bug #3 — ninjastic2008, Discord 05.05.). New Tauri command `detect_all_comfyui_installs` returns a `Vec<ComfyUIInstall>` with `{ path, complete, has_embedded_python, source }`. The onboarding effect now calls it first; when more than one match exists, the user picks explicitly via a clickable list (each row shows "ready / needs setup" + "found via …" + a "bundles python_embeded" badge). The chosen path is persisted via the existing `set_comfyui_path` command so `start_comfyui` hits it. Single-hit and zero-hit cases keep the previous auto-pick / install-fresh flow.
- **ComfyUI install: Cancel button + disk-pressure pre-flight + ETA** (Bug #1 — techx69, Discord 06.05.). The 45-minute hang case on a 100%-busy drive used to leave the user with no way out. New Tauri command `cancel_comfyui_install` flips a `Arc<AtomicBool>` in `AppState.comfyui_install_cancel`; the install thread polls it between every step and inside the pip retry loop, kills the active git or pip child on cancel, and lands the status in `"cancelled"` so the polling UI clears. Pre-flight uses `sysinfo::Disks` to detect <5 GB free on the target drive and pushes a `⚠`-prefixed warning into the install logs (rendered as a yellow band above the live log card). Progress card now shows a rolling ETA (`download_total - download_progress` / `download_speed`) next to the elapsed timer.
- **PyTorch wheel routing now respects GPU compute capability** (Bug #10 — vokurta, GitHub Discussion #37, 11.05.). `install_comfyui` probes `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap` and picks `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128` when any visible GPU reports SM ≥ 12.0 (Blackwell — RTX 50xx, RTX 6000 Pro), `cu121` otherwise. The probe is best-effort; failure falls back to cu121 so existing Ampere/Hopper installs don't regress. Fixes `CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device` at `CLIPTextEncode` on Blackwell silicon.

### Fixed — chat surface
- **TokenCounter now reflects the Settings `maxTokens` override live** (Bug #4 — phantomderp, Discord 05.05.). The component used to read `getModelMaxTokens(activeModel)` once per model switch and ignore subsequent settings changes, so a slider move from default → 16384 stayed pinned to the model's manifest value (e.g. 8.2k). It now subscribes to `useSettingsStore` so Zustand re-renders on every settings update; the effective ceiling is `settings.maxTokens > 0 ? settings.maxTokens : modelMax`, and the tooltip surfaces both when the user is overriding.
- **DownloadBadge X-button actually cancels the Rust pull stream** (Bug #5 — phantomderp, Discord 05.05.). `modelStore.dismissPull` used to just delete the entry from `activePulls` — Rust's `pull_model_stream` kept emitting `pull-progress` events and the badge respawned within 100 ms while the disk kept writing. The action now aborts the entry's `AbortController` (which fires the existing `cancel` handler installed by `useModels.pullModel`) AND best-effort invokes `cancel_model_pull` directly. Five new unit tests in `src/stores/__tests__/modelStore-dismiss.test.ts` cover abort propagation, Rust invocation, synchronous state removal, the no-op-when-not-present case, and the late-progress-event guard.
- **Agent-Mode hint when a model tries to call tools without the toggle on** (Bug #7 — phantomderp, Discord 04.05.). `MessageBubble` now runs `extractToolCallsFromContent` on every assistant message; when a call is detected, the conversation is in normal (non-agent) mode, AND the active model passes `isAgentCompatible`, an amber banner renders below the message: "This model tried to call a tool, but Agent Mode is off for this chat. Turn it on …" with a one-click Enable Agent button. Previously the user saw the raw JSON dump rendered as Markdown and assumed the model was broken.

### Fixed — image / video creation
- **Workflow-architecture mismatch surfaces a clear install path** (Bug #6 — vvvxxxvvv_80435 Discord 04.05., Turbulent_Tomato7559 Reddit 10.05.). When the active ComfyUI lacks the wrapper nodes for the chosen video model (CogVideoX → `CogVideoXSampler`, FramePack → `FramePackSampler`, Pyramid Flow → `PyramidFlowSampler`, Allegro → community wrapper), `determineStrategy` now returns an `installHint: { pack, url }` alongside the error. The dynamic builder throws a typed `WorkflowUnavailableError` instead of a generic `Error`. `useCreate` recognises that subclass and surfaces the message + install-guide path instead of falling through to the legacy builder (which hits the same `UNETLoader` trap). New helper `checkVideoOutputCapability` lets the Create flow surface a yellow "output will be animated .webp" heads-up when `VHS_VideoCombine` is missing — same root cause as Turbulent_Tomato7559's Reddit report ("videos generate as .webp").

### Tests
- `vitest`: 93 files / 2264 tests green (was 92 / 2254 — +5 for Bug #5 cancel propagation in `modelStore-dismiss.test.ts`, +5 for Bug #6 install-hint coverage in `dynamic-workflow-strategy.test.ts`).
- `cargo test --release`: 52 passed (was 44 — +8 for Bug #10 `parse_compute_cap_output` covering Ampere SM 8.6, Ada SM 8.9, Hopper SM 9.0, Blackwell SM 12.0, multi-GPU pick-highest, blank/empty/unparseable edges).
- `cargo check`: clean (1 dead-code warning on unused `save_binary_file_dialog`, pre-existing).
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean.

### Verification
- See `LU-E2E-Test-Kit/docs/03-E2E-TEST-PLAN.md` for the per-bug repro recipes used to validate this sweep on Windows 10 + RTX-class hardware.
- Phase 1 Live-E2E (`test-results-2026-05-11.md`): 5/8 bugs verified live via Computer-Use (#2, #3, #4, #5, #7). Performance regression discovered + fixed during Phase 1 (`detect_all_comfyui_installs` made async via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` after the initial sync version blocked the UI for 30+ s on a typical home directory).
- Phase 2 Re-Verification (`test-results-2026-05-11-phase2.md`): same 5 live bugs re-confirmed in both configured-state and complete-fresh-state runs (AppData + WebView2 user-data dir renamed aside, fresh launch, full onboarding walk-through). 3 remaining bugs (#1 ComfyUI install cancel, #6 wrapper-installed workflows, #10 Blackwell wheels) are code + unit-test verified — invasive to validate live without Blackwell silicon, a slow disk, or CogVideoX wrapper nodes installed.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed — LM Studio onboarding plug-and-play
- **Pre-bootstrap `lms.exe` path lookup** — on a freshly-installed LM Studio the `lms` CLI lives at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\LM Studio\resources\app\.webpack\lms.exe` until the GUI has been launched once. `lmstudio_lms_path()` now uses a three-stage lookup: (1) `~/.lmstudio/bin/lms.exe` (post-bootstrap), (2) the pre-bootstrap webpack path above, (3) `PATH`. Before this, the in-app `install_lmstudio` flow on a true-fresh box died with "lms not found" because the bootstrap step couldn't locate the binary it needed to bootstrap.
- **Two-pass GUI bootstrap dance** — `install_lmstudio` now runs `lms bootstrap`, and if `~/.lmstudio/bin/lms.exe` is still missing afterward it launches the LM Studio GUI minimally, polls up to 30 s for `~/.lmstudio/` to populate, then retries the bootstrap. The server-start step re-resolves the path after the dance. End-user-visible effect: no more "open LM Studio once and come back" instructions on a fresh install.
- **Skip download when LM Studio is already installed** — `install_lmstudio` pre-checks via `lmstudio_lms_path().is_some()` and short-circuits the 570 MB download + installer step, jumping straight to bootstrap + server start. Plus a further short-circuit to "complete" if `already_installed && server_running`. Stops a re-download from happening every time someone toggles the server on.
- **Onboarding "LM Studio offline → start server" card** — `runDetection` now calls `lmstudio_server_status` after `detectLocalBackends` returns. When `lms_present && !running` the Backends step flips into a `lmstudioOfflineDetected` state: headline becomes "LM Studio detected", the primary button reads "Start LM Studio server" and styles as primary, and the Ollama-install button hides. Same `install_lmstudio` Tauri command (with the skip-download short-circuit above) handles the click.
- **Settings → AI Backends inline "Start Server" button** — `ProviderConfig.tsx` calls `lmstudio_server_status` on mount and after each Test click. When the provider is the `lmstudio` preset, `lms_present && !running` and the connection isn't already 'connected', a green inline `▶ Start Server` button renders between Disable and the status pill. Click runs `start_lmstudio_server`, polls up to 30 s on `running`, then re-tests the connection (status dot flips red → green in ~8 s).
- **Actionable runtime hint for "No LM Runtime found"** — `openai-provider.ts::parseError` now matches LM Studio's raw API error via `/no\s+lm\s+runtime\s+found/i` and replaces the assistant message with a 3-step "Open LM Studio → Discover → Runtimes → llama.cpp (CPU)" instruction. Sets `code='lmstudio_runtime_missing'` for future UI branches. Three vitest unit tests in `provider-openai.test.ts` cover detection, case-insensitivity, and no false-positive on other 400-class errors.

### Fixed — onboarding & picker
- **Models step recommended-starter card now unblocked on a truly-fresh install** — the `modelSubTab` initial value is computed from `ONBOARDING_MODELS.some(m => m.uncensored)`. With the v2.4.0 P4 trim that left only Qwen 2.5 0.5B (mainstream), the tab now starts on `'mainstream'` instead of `'uncensored'`, so the Qwen card actually renders. Previously the Models step looked empty on a fresh install — diagnosed in sweep #3 as an `existingModelCount` issue, which was the wrong root cause; sweep #4 found the real one.
- **Embedding-only models filtered from `existingModelCount`** — `listModels` results now run through an `embed`/`bge-`/`nomic` filter (same pattern as `scanInstalledModels`). LM Studio's default `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5` no longer counts toward "user already has a model installed" and no longer pollutes the chat-model picker.

### Fixed — theme & UI polish
- **Dark theme from frame 1** — `<html class="dark">` set in `index.html` plus inline `#0a0a0a` body background, `useLayoutEffect` in `AppShell` to apply theme synchronously before paint, and the onboarding theme step removed entirely (5 step indicators instead of 6). Light theme remains available in Settings → General → Appearance. Resolves a "is from build to build different, should be black always" report — first-paint flash is gone, theme is consistent across builds.
- **XP-style scrollbar arrows removed from chat input** — `.scrollbar-thin::-webkit-scrollbar-button` (all `:start/:end/:vertical/:horizontal` permutations) set to `display:none, width:0, height:0`. The chat input `<textarea>` carries `.scrollbar-thin`. Result: clean 6 px thumb, no decorative arrow chrome.

### Fixed — HF model search (carry-over from quiet sweep)
- **HF search no longer crashes the dropdown on repo-path queries** — `baseName` ReferenceError that fired when the query contained a `/` (e.g. `bartowski/Llama-3.1`) caused the dropdown to render zero hits with a console error. Path-aware parser now extracts the file name correctly.
- **HF search is case-insensitive** — query and candidate names both `toLowerCase()`-normalized before matching, so `qwen` and `Qwen` return the same set.
- **Picker resets when the selected model is no longer in the list** — instead of locking on a dead choice, the picker drops the selection back to the placeholder when its current model isn't present in the freshly-fetched list.

### Fixed — Remote Access dev-mode (carries forward from `[Unreleased]` block)
- **Remote Access in `npm run dev` now surfaces a clear actionable message instead of a cryptic 404 + JSON.parse stacktrace** — reported on Discord in `#bug-reports` by @phantomderp on v2.4.2: clicking the LAN button printed `POST http://localhost:5173/local-api/start-remote-server [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found]` and clicking Internet showed an `Error: HTTP 404` toast plus `Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data`. Root cause: Remote Access is a Tauri-only feature (a Rust axum server, JWT auth, Cloudflare tunnel binary management, mobile-UI static serve — ~3700 lines in `src-tauri/src/commands/remote.rs`). When v2.4.2 added the corresponding `/local-api/*` paths to `src/api/backend.ts`'s endpoint map, no matching middleware was added to `vite.config.ts`, so dev-mode clicks fell through to vite's default 404 HTML page, which the frontend then tried to JSON.parse. End-user impact: zero — the installed `.exe` routes through Tauri's `invoke()` and works as designed. Developer impact: a confusing dead-end when iterating on the UI from `npm run dev`. Mirroring the entire feature in Node middleware would be a maintenance trap, so we keep dev lean and instead: (1) `Sidebar.handleDispatch` and the `remoteStore.startServer` / `restart` / `startTunnel` actions all check `isTauri()` first and short-circuit with `REMOTE_DEV_MODE_ERROR` — a single source-of-truth string that points at `npm run tauri:dev` (Tauri-aware dev mode where Remote works fully) or the installed app; (2) all 12 Remote-related vite middlewares are stubbed to return `HTTP 501 + { error, devModeOnly: true }` as a backstop in case any future caller bypasses the store guards.

### Tests
- `vitest`: 2254 / 2254 green (+3 new tests for the LM-Studio runtime-missing rewrite, +5 from the carried-forward Remote dev-mode short-circuit set, +2 adjusted constants-validation cases).
- `cargo test`: 44 / 44 green (Rust unit tests).
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean.
- `cargo check`: clean (one pre-existing dead-code warning on `save_binary_file_dialog`, unrelated to this sweep).

### Verification
- **Fresh-fresh-box live trace.** LM Studio uninstall (`Remove-Item $LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\"LM Studio"`) + `~/.lmstudio` purge + LU AppData reset → onboarding shows "No local backend detected" → click "Or install LM Studio" → silent install → "Bootstrapping `lms` CLI" log proves `lmstudio_lms_path()` found the pre-bootstrap path (because `~/.lmstudio/bin/` did not exist yet) → Pass-2 GUI flash proves `lmstudio_gui_exe()` populated `~/.lmstudio/` → "Starting LM Studio server..." → "LM Studio is ready (server on :1234)". Total ~1:35 including the download. Sweep-#3 code died at the `lms.exe not found` step.
- **Skip-download path.** With LM Studio already installed: `install_lmstudio` log shows "LM Studio is already installed — skipping download. Bootstrapping CLI and starting server…", server up at `:1234` in 8 s, zero MB downloaded.
- **Onboarding offline-detection card.** AppData reset → Backends step shows the new "LM Studio detected" headline + "is installed but its server isn't currently running…" paragraph + primary button "Start LM Studio server". Ollama-install button hidden.
- **Models step starter card.** Qwen 2.5 0.5B card visible with "Recommended" badge, "0.4 GB · VRAM: 1 GB". Pre-fix the step rendered with only "Skip for now".
- **GGUF download path.** File lands at `~/.lmstudio/models/bartowski/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf` (379.4 MB).
- **Picker filters embeddings.** With LM Studio's default embedding model present, only `qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct (LM Studio)` shows in the chat picker.
- **End-to-end inference.** Chat prompt "Hello! Reply with exactly: pong" via LM Studio :1234 + Qwen 2.5 0.5B → "Pong!" (20/8.2k tokens). Full pipe: LU → Rust proxy → LM Studio → Qwen → back.
- **Settings inline Start-Server button.** With server stopped: Settings → AI Backends → LM Studio expand → green ▶ Start Server button renders → click → "Connected" in 8 s.
- **Theme dark from frame 1.** Post-AppData-reset launch: dark from frame 1, 5 step indicators (was 6), Welcome → Backends direct, no white flash.
- **Scrollbar visual.** 20-line test input → 6 px thumb, no arrow buttons. Zoom-verified.

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.4.2. No breaking changes, no localStorage migration. Auto-update prompts on next launch.
- **Heads-up — extra-active first week.** Build environment for this release was different from usual. CI ships the same x64 + Linux installers as always, but to catch anything that slipped through the live-test pass: `#bug-reports` / `#help-*` / GitHub will be checked daily for the next ~5 days. If something behaves off after updating, please drop a note — fix turnaround should be fast (a v2.4.4 hotfix lands the same way auto-update did v2.4.3).
- **Carrying forward into next sweep:** AMD video-generation "could not detect model type" + empty-output reports on Threadripper / RX 7900 XTX (vvvxxxvvv on Discord). Internet-Remote feature-request to support `npm run dev`. Beads memory-plugin design (Discussion #34).

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Updates tab no longer shows a stale "Latest Version" after a manual binary upgrade** — reported on Discord by @diimmortalis: "I tried and failed to auto-update from the .deb package in i think 2.3.7, and now the updates tab says `Current Version: 2.4.1 | Latest Version: 2.3.8`." Root cause: zustand's `persist` middleware partializes `latestVersion` into localStorage, so when a user updates the binary out-of-band the persisted "latest" snapshot survives even though it's now older than what they're running. `checkForUpdate()` has a 6h cooldown, so the stale value lingers for hours. Fix: added `onRehydrateStorage` to `updateStore` that compares persisted `latestVersion` against `currentVersion` via the existing `isNewerVersion` helper and resets `latestVersion = null, updateAvailable = false, releaseNotes = null, lastChecked = null` when the persisted snapshot isn't strictly newer. Plus a UI hardening pass in `SettingsPage`'s `UpdateSection`: the "Latest Version" row now only renders when the persisted value really is newer than current, so even a missed rehydration can't display the inversion.
- **Agent toggle now correctly enables for uncensored / abliterated variants of agent-capable bases** — reported by @diimmortalis on Discord with `LEONW24/Qwen3.5-9B-Uncensored:Q4_K_M`. The previous `isAgentCompatible` carried a deliberately narrow allow-list for abliterated/uncensored model names (`['qwen3-coder', 'hermes3', 'hermes-3', 'hermes']`) that over-rejected popular Qwen 3.x, Llama 3.x, Gemma 4, Mistral, and Qwen 2.5 abliterations even though those families retain native tool-calling weights through abliteration. Fix: the abliterated/uncensored branch now strips the `-abliterated` / `-uncensored` / `-instruct` / `-chat` / `:tag` suffixes and checks the remaining base name against the same canonical `AGENT_COMPATIBLE` list as the vanilla path. Three regression tests added in `model-compatibility.test.ts` covering the diimmortalis case + `mannix/llama3.1-8b-abliterated` + `huihui_ai/qwen2.5-abliterated`.
- **CivitAI model search now uses the API key from the Workflow finder + shows a clear empty-state hint** — reported by @diimmortalis: "CivitAI model search doesn't seem to work — i think it's because the api-key was only accepted for the Workflow finder under the Create Tab, but i'm not finding any errors in the console or network tab, just says it's getting back an empty model list." Fix: `searchCivitaiModels(query, type, apiKey?)` in `discover.ts` now appends `&token=<apiKey>` when set and adds `nsfw=true` to surface adult content (matching LU's positioning). The DiscoverModels CivitAI panel reads the same key the Workflow finder writes via `workflowStore.civitaiApiKey`. New `civitaiSearched` state distinguishes "before-first-search" from "search-returned-zero" and renders an empty-state hint — `No matches for "<query>". Try a broader query, or add your CivitAI API key in the Workflow finder for the full catalog.` — instead of leaving the user staring at a silent empty list.
- **Import Workflow now shows a visible success confirmation** — reported by @diimmortalis: "doesn't seem to persist manually entered json, and doesn't document where the file would be stored. There's no feedback or console output when clicking the 'Import' button." The import was actually persisting fine, but the UI cleared the inputs on success and emitted zero feedback, so the click looked like a no-op. Fix: added `importSuccess` state to `WorkflowSearchModal` and an emerald-green confirmation row that reads `Imported "<name>" and assigned to <modelName>.` after a successful URL or JSON paste; auto-clears after 4s.
- **Newly downloaded ComfyUI models surface in the dropdown more reliably** — reported on GitHub Discussion #22 by @Draekzy and @cprovencher-beep. Two timing-related races were stacking: (1) `refreshComfyModels` was single-shot and silently returned `false` if ComfyUI was mid-startup or busy, leaving the cache stale; (2) the `comfyui-model-downloaded` event handler in `useCreate` called `fetchModels()` exactly once, so if ComfyUI's directory scan took longer than the `/api/refresh` round-trip the immediate fetch saw the pre-scan list. Fix: `refreshComfyModels(maxAttempts = 3)` retries with 1s + 2s backoff on transient failure, and the post-download handler now schedules `fetchModels()` immediately + at +2s + at +6s with proper timer cleanup on unmount. Live-traced in DevTools: a single dispatched event now produces 8 `/api/refresh` calls inside 8s, where pre-fix it produced 1. Doesn't address adjacent root causes like file-permission issues (running ComfyUI as admin to access models) or a misconfigured `Settings → ComfyUI → Path` — those are separate problems.

### Carrying forward from master (commit 9eb1329)
- **Remote Access "Server stopped — restart does nothing" silent-failure path is fixed** — reported on issue #29 by @phantomderp13. Internet remote rethrows on failure instead of swallowing the error, orphan tunnels are cleaned up, and the inline error surfaces in the UI.
- **Anti-Virus false-positive groundwork** — reported on issue #33 by @spiritwarri0r. Bundle metadata + signed installer carry forward; v2.4.1 already addressed most ESET / Avast hits.

### Docs
- **Blog correction: SillyTavern image generation** — reported by @diimmortalis. The "Best local AI apps 2026" comparison and the "Locally Uncensored vs SillyTavern" deep-dive both incorrectly listed SillyTavern as having no image generation support. SillyTavern does support image generation through its Stable Diffusion / ComfyUI extension; the table cell + descriptive text now reflect that, while keeping the built-in vs extension distinction honest.

### Tests
- Test suite 2244 → 2246 (+2 regression assertions in `updateStore.test.ts` pinning the diimmortalis 2.3.8/2.4.1 inversion case).
- 3 inverted assertions in `model-compatibility.test.ts` flipped to match the new unified abliterated handling — the previous "abliterated NOT compatible" expectations were encoding the bug, not desired behavior.

### Verification
- `vitest`: 2246 / 2246 green
- `cargo test`: 44 / 44 green
- Built v2.4.2 installer + silent-installed over the prior v2.4.1 binary on a real Windows machine, then reproduced each bug's mechanism in the running app:
  - B1: seeded `latestVersion: '2.3.8'` into localStorage + reloaded — Settings → Updates correctly shows `Current Version: v2.4.2` + "You are on the latest version", no stale row.
  - B2: 7-case assertion table run in DevTools console — diimmortalis's exact model + 3 other abliterated bases all return true, plus 3 negative cases (embedding model + unknown-base abliteration) correctly stay false.
  - B3: searching "flux" in CivitAI panel renders the empty-state hint as designed.
  - B4: pasted ComfyUI JSON twice with different names → both workflows persisted + assigned, visible in the WORKFLOW dropdown.
  - B5: instrumented `window.fetch`, dispatched the download-completed event once, traced 8 `/api/refresh` calls within 8s spanning the immediate / +2s / +6s × 3-attempt-retry pattern.

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.4.1. No breaking changes, no localStorage migration. Auto-update prompts on next launch. Existing users roll over automatically.
- We don't claim 100% reliability for any of these — if the symptoms still show up after updating, please drop a note in the matching issue / discussion / Discord thread. We'd rather hear about it.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **CreateTopControls: picker dropdown hardened against any non-array list value** — reported on Discord by @phantomderp on the `#bug-reports` channel: "the web ui crashes when clicking on the model list at the top in the create tab". His workaround was to patch `activeList?.map(...)` in the source, which stopped the crash but "the list doesn't work anymore" because the `.length` branch above still evaluates on undefined. We already did the straightforward fix in v2.3.9 / v2.4.0 (added `imageModelList` / `videoModelList` to `createStore` as runtime-only state, populated by `useCreate.fetchModels`), but there's still a pathological path where the field arrives as something other than an array: stale persisted state from a very old install, Zustand rehydration racing the first render of `CreateTopControls`, a corrupted localStorage entry from an external tool, or simply an old .exe that predates aa31bab. The read site now passes the list through `Array.isArray(rawList) ? rawList : []`, so undefined / null / object / string / number / anything weird all render as the empty-state card instead of taking the app down.

### Tests
- Test suite 2216 → 2226 (+7 regression tests in `createStore.test.ts` — new "activeList fallback contract (mirrors CreateTopControls)" describe block covers undefined / null / object-with-wrong-shape / string / real-populated-array cases, plus a `.length && .map never throw on the fallback` guard).

### Verification
- `vitest`: 2226 / 2226 green
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean
- Bundled JS contains the fix (grep-confirmed `Array.isArray(h)?h:[]` in the minified `index-*.js`)
- Dev-preview E2E: injected undefined / null / `{}` / `"corrupted"` / `42` / populated-array into the store and clicked the picker — zero errors across all six scenarios
- Installed-binary E2E, happy-path: Ollama + ComfyUI running with 3 image + 3 video models — picker shows all 6 models, no crash in either mode
- Installed-binary E2E, true fresh-user simulation: Ollama folder renamed, ComfyUI folder renamed, LU AppData wiped — picker shows "Start ComfyUI to load models" empty-state, no crash in either mode; Chat / Create / Compare / Benchmark / Models / Settings all load cleanly from fresh install

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.4.0. No breaking changes, no localStorage migration. Existing users auto-update on next launch.
- Single-file behavior fix + tests — no new features, no dependency bumps. If you were already on v2.4.0 with working model lists, you won't see a behavior change.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Double-launch no longer spawns a second LU process** — clicking the shortcut twice (or "Run" in the NSIS installer after install) used to produce two `locally-uncensored.exe` PIDs. Both triads wrote to `%APPDATA%/Locally Uncensored/store_backup.json` racing each other, occasionally overwriting a just-flushed backup mid-write. Fixed with `tauri-plugin-single-instance`: the 2nd launch now focuses + un-minimizes the existing window instead of creating a new process. Found during the internal 2.3.9 Ultra E2E pass.
- **Settings → Agent Permissions → "Reset tutorial" button actually resets the tutorial now** — the onClick called `setTutorialCompleted()` which unconditionally sets `tutorialCompleted: true`. Clicking it on a fresh install silently *skipped* the tour, and clicking it after seeing the tour did nothing at all. Added a new `resetTutorial()` action in `agentModeStore` that sets `tutorialCompleted: false`, wired the button to it, added a regression test in `stores.test.ts`.
- **Discover tab no longer shows the HuggingFace download path twice** — both the section subtitle and a second `<p>` below the download grid rendered "Saves to: …" / "Downloads save to: …". Removed the duplicate.
- **Linux window can be dragged again** — on Ubuntu 24.04 the title-bar drag threw `Unhandled Promise Rejection: window.start_dragging not allowed. Permissions associated with this command: core:window:allow-start-dragging` and left the window anchored in place (keyboard tiling still worked, so nobody noticed on tile-first setups). Reported on Discord by @diimmortalis. Added `core:window:allow-start-dragging` to `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`.
- **"Re-run onboarding" actually reruns onboarding now** — first cut of the button deleted the marker file + flipped `settings.onboardingDone` + reloaded, but `AppShell.tsx`'s mount-time "migration" block saw the missing marker and happily wrote it back, dropping the user straight into the main app instead of the wizard. The migration is now gated on `settings.onboardingDone === true` so it only fires for legitimate NSIS-update-after-onboarding scenarios, not for the intentionally-missing marker of a Re-run click. Caught during E2E of the 2.4.0 RC. Regression test in `AppShell-backup-triad.test.ts`.
- **HuggingFace search filename heuristic no longer doubles quant suffixes** — typing "tinyllama Q4" into Model Manager → Discover → Text → (search) returned repos like `hieupt/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-Q4_K_M-GGUF`, and the client then guessed the inner filename as `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-Q4_K_M-Q4_K_M.gguf` — doubled tag, guaranteed 404 when you clicked download. Extracted the guess into `deriveQ4FilenameFromRepo()`, added a case-insensitive quant-suffix detector (`Q[0-9]+_K_[MSL]`, `Q[0-9]_[0-9]+`, `IQ[0-9]_[A-Z]+`, `UD-Q/-IQ`, `BF16/FP16/F16/F32`). If the suffix is already in the repo name, the `.gguf` is appended directly; otherwise `-Q4_K_M.gguf` stays as before. Full E2E with a curated model (Gemma 4 E4B @ 4.6 GB) confirmed the Model Storage override path is honored — bytes land in the picked folder, LM Studio's default folder is not touched. 9 new regression tests in `discover-hf-filename.test.ts`.

### Added
- **Settings → Privacy section** — explicit in-app statement of what the app does and doesn't do with your data. Until 2.3.9 this only existed in the README, which meant if you couldn't be bothered to open GitHub you were taking the claim on faith. Now Settings lists: 100% local by default, no telemetry/analytics, only network calls are the GitHub updater and cloud-provider APIs you configure yourself; + where your data lives on disk (`%APPDATA%/Locally Uncensored`).
- **Settings → Onboarding → "Re-run onboarding" button** — once you'd clicked through the first-launch wizard it was gone forever unless you hit "Reset to Defaults" (which wipes every other preference). Now Settings has a dedicated "Onboarding" section with a button that clears the `onboarding_done` marker on disk + resets the in-app flag + reloads. Useful when you want to redo the hardware scan, show the app to a friend, or just re-read the agent-mode tour. The `set_onboarding_done` Rust command now accepts `Option<bool>` so callers can also clear the marker, not only set it.
- **Settings → Model Storage: configurable HuggingFace GGUF download path** — requested in Discord by @diimmortalis (dual-boot Ubuntu user wanting the HF downloads on a shared partition instead of `/home/$USER/locally-uncensored/models`). New `hfDownloadPathOverride` in settings — leave empty to keep the previous auto-detect-from-provider behaviour, or pick a folder via the native picker. `DiscoverModels.tsx` now prefers the override over the auto-detected LM-Studio path. Takes effect immediately without restart.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md — ComfyUI CORS note for contributors bringing their own instance** — LU's auto-started ComfyUI already passes `--enable-cors-header "*"`, but contributors who point `npm run tauri:dev` at their own long-running ComfyUI see a `403` + `request with non matching host and origin localhost:8188 != localhost:5173` warning. Flagged on Discord by @diimmortalis after they self-diagnosed + self-fixed. Docs now spell out the workaround.

### Changed
- Test suite 2205 → 2216 (+11 regression tests: `resetTutorial` flips `tutorialCompleted` back to `false`, AppShell onboarding-marker migration is gated on `onboardingDone`, 9 cases for `deriveQ4FilenameFromRepo` covering Q-tag / IQ-tag / UD- / BF16 / lowercase / mid-string / no-GGUF variants).
- Bumped `package.json` / `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` / `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` 2.3.9 → 2.4.0 in lockstep.

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.9. No breaking changes. No localStorage migration. `hfDownloadPathOverride` defaults to empty, which preserves pre-2.4.0 behaviour (auto-detect from the active openai-compat provider).
- Version train: 2.4.0 is a polish release consolidating the 6 non-blocker findings from the internal Ultra E2E sweep + the 2 bug + 1 feature request from Discord community feedback over the 2.3.x cycle. No new headline features — the next headline bump is planned for 2.5.0 (see project roadmap).

## [2.3.9] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Create view no longer takes down the whole app when no image or video model is installed** — reported on Discord by @figuringitallout on a fresh Windows install. Observable symptom: open Create with an empty ComfyUI `models/` tree, app unresponsive → hard shutdown → a "duplicate" LU process opens. Two layered root causes, both fixed:
  - (1) `classifyModel()` in `src/api/comfyui.ts` used to happily dereference `name.toLowerCase()` without checking `name` first; a stale persisted model string (from a previous install that got deleted) was carried into every Create render path and bubbled through `useCreate.generate`, `ParamPanel`, and the dynamic-workflow builder. Now `classifyModel(name: string | null | undefined)` returns `'unknown'` when `!name`.
  - (2) `src/hooks/useCreate.ts:fetchModels` only cleared the persisted image/video model names when ComfyUI returned a non-empty list. With 0 models, the stale strings stayed alive forever. Now fetchModels explicitly `state.setImageModel('', 'unknown')` + `state.setVideoModel('')` when the corresponding list is empty after the startup-race retries expire.
  - (3) `src/components/create/CreateView.tsx` renders a dedicated empty-state card when `connected === true && modelsLoaded && currentModeModels.length === 0`. The card shows `PackageOpen` icon + "No {image|video} models installed" + a **Go to Model Manager** primary button (calls `useUIStore.getState().setView('models')`) + a **Refresh list** secondary action (calls `fetchModels()`). `OutputDisplay` / `PromptInput` / `ParamPanel` / I2V + I2I uploads / preflight banners all suppress during the empty state so no downstream code can hit the old crash path. The Mode switcher (Image / Video) stays so the user can switch sides and get a matching empty-state.

- **CreateTopControls no longer crashes the Create header toggle + dropdown** — the header-level model picker + ComfyUI Lichtschalter lives at `src/components/create/CreateTopControls.tsx` and used to destructure four fields (`imageModelList`, `videoModelList`, `comfyRunning`, `setComfyRunning`) from `useCreateStore()` that were never added to the store. Clicking the dropdown threw `TypeError: can't access property "length", activeList is undefined`; clicking the Lichtschalter during starting/stopping threw `setComfyRunning is not a function`. Reported on Discord by @diimmortalis (with a precise console-log dump, bless them — Ubuntu 24.04 + `npm run dev`). Fix: the four missing fields are now part of `createStore` as runtime-only (not persisted) state; `useCreate.fetchModels` + `useCreate.checkConnection` mirror their values into the store so the header control always has a live list + the right toggle state.
- **Backend Selector modal no longer spams on repeat** — users with multiple local backends (Ollama + LM Studio, Ollama + vLLM, etc) reported on Discord that the "N local backends detected" modal kept re-appearing every 5-10 seconds, regardless of whether they clicked Skip or Use selected. The pre-existing `sessionStorage` guard wasn't enough in the face of WebView2 reloads (which the backup-restore triad can trigger) or cache evictions. Fix: (1) added a persistent `hideBackendSelector` flag in `providerStore` so the user's opt-out survives reloads; (2) the modal now has a pre-checked "Don't show this again" tickbox; (3) a permanent explanatory line "You can add, remove, or switch backends anytime in **Settings → Providers**" (with the link clickable — it navigates you there); (4) dismissing the modal with the tickbox checked persists the opt-out. Users who want the modal back at some point can uncheck the box before dismissing.
- **LU always starts in the Chat sidebar tab, not Code** — on a fresh install or an NSIS update, the left-sidebar tab (Chat / Code / Remote) could land on Code because `codexStore`'s persist middleware saved `chatMode` between sessions. Newcomers clicking around Code without any conversations got an empty screen. `codexStore` now excludes `chatMode` from `partialize` so the default (`'lu'`) is used on every fresh boot. If a user wants to stay in Codex or Claude Code mid-session, they pick it from the sidebar each time; `workingDirectory` still persists so Codex remembers the last project path.
- Tiny grammar fix in the Create empty-state copy: "Install **an image** model" / "Install **a video** model" (was "Install a image model" in both branches).

### Added
- **CONTRIBUTING.md — Dev Setup now documents all three local dev workflows** (`npm run tauri:dev` for hot-reload with Rust rebuilds, `npm run dev` for browser-only UI work, `npm run tauri:build` for a full NSIS installer). Reported in Discord by @k-wilkinson (sourceodin) as a missing-docs ask. Clarifies that Tauri invokes only resolve under `tauri:dev`.

### Changed
- Bumped `package.json` 2.3.7 → 2.3.9 (was lagging behind `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`). Bumped `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` 2.3.7 → 2.3.9 (also lagging). Website + download URLs + schema.org metadata updated to 2.3.9.
- Test suite 2202 → 2204 (+2 regression tests: `classifyModel` null-safety + `chatMode` default-on-boot).

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.8. No breaking changes. No localStorage migration.
- v2.3.8's "Codex is still evolving" caveat still applies — this release does not advance that feature; it only hardens the Create view and refreshes dev docs.

## [2.3.8] - 2026-04-22

> **Note on Codex:** several Codex plumbing bugs are fixed below, but Codex is still an actively-evolving feature and is not yet treated as production-finished. This section is a developer-facing technical changelog. The user-facing release announcements (GitHub Release notes, README, Discord) intentionally describe this as internal plumbing + UX polish rather than a Codex milestone.

### Fixed
- **Codex `file_write` now actually lands on disk in the expected folder** — the built-in tool executors (`fs_read`, `fs_write`, `fs_list`, `fs_search`, `shell_execute`, `execute_code`) in `src/api/mcp/builtin-tools.ts` never threaded the active chat-id through to Rust even though `agent-context.ts` was designed for exactly that. The documented per-chat workspace isolation (`~/agent-workspace/<chatId>/`) silently fell through to a shared `default/` fallback whenever the model emitted a relative path, and no per-chat isolation ever happened. Now every executor reads `getActiveChatId()` and spreads it into the `backendCall` payload so Rust's `resolve_path()` / `resolve_agent_path()` can route relative paths into the right per-chat folder. `src/api/agents.ts:executeTool` also now returns the real `data.path` from Rust's `{status:"saved", path:…}` response instead of a hard-coded `"File written successfully"` string that masked write failures behind a green ✓ in the UI.
- **Codex chat bubble no longer floods with raw `{"name":"file_write", "arguments":{…}}` JSON objects for models that emit tool calls as content** — qwen2.5-coder:3b and similar small coder models put the tool call in the `content` field instead of the native `tool_calls` array. The pre-2.3.8 extractor caught the call but left the raw JSON visible in the chat, and the narrative around it ("I'm about to verify…" + ```python fence echoing the file content) was concatenated onto `fullContent` every iteration — a 4-iteration task rendered as four stacked JSON blobs with four duplicated paragraphs. Fix: new `stripRanges()` helper uses the `[startIdx, endIdx]` positions the balanced-brace extractor already computes to remove the exact tool-call substrings (not a greedy regex that fails on nested braces), and an `extractedFromContent` flag drops the residual narrative entirely so qwen's Codex UI now looks identical to gemma4's.
- **Balanced-brace JSON extractor replaces the greedy `\{[^}]*\}` regex** — the old regex failed on any JSON with nested braces OR string values containing `{` (e.g. Python f-strings `f'Hello, {name}!'` emitted by qwen2.5-coder). Replaced with a locate-header-then-balance scanner that respects string escapes. Fixes `extractToolCallsFromContent` for any code that uses f-strings or dict literals in string values.
- **Arg-validator error-hint now lists the exact missing fields with types and what the model actually sent** — pre-2.3.8 the generic "Re-issue the tool call with valid arguments matching the tool schema" hint meant small models (hermes3:8b, qwen2.5-coder:3b) kept retrying the same malformed call. Now the hint looks like `file_write requires {path: string, content: string}. You sent {command}. Retry with all required fields present.` — concrete enough that small models actually self-correct.

### Added
- **Context compaction in Codex** — long multi-tool turns used to blow past 8K-context local models' windows; Codex now mirrors Agent Mode's `compactMessages(…, Math.floor(maxCtx * 0.8))` call before each sampling pass, summarising older turns while keeping recent messages intact.
- **Memory injection + extraction in Codex** — Codex was the only chat surface that ignored the memory system. It now reads `useMemoryStore.getState().getMemoriesForPrompt(instruction, contextTokens)` into the system prompt at dispatch time, and runs `extractMemoriesFromPair()` after the turn lands. Parity with Chat + Agent Mode.
- **`CODEX_CATEGORIES` tool-scope filter** — Codex now filters `toolRegistry.getAll()` to the `filesystem | terminal | system | web` categories before passing tools to the model. The pre-2.3.8 code had the constant defined but never used, so small models were getting confused by `image_generate`, `screenshot`, `run_workflow`, and `process_list` showing up next to `file_write` and emitting tool calls with the wrong argument shape (confirmed repro: hermes3:8b calling `file_write({command: "python -m unittest …"})` when both shell_execute and file_write were in scope). The filter narrows the blade.
- **Codex iter cap raised 20 → 50** — large refactors across 10+ files legitimately need more than 20 tool calls. Budget still caps via `agentMaxToolCalls` / `agentMaxIterations` (defaults 50 / 25 from settings).
- **Family grouping in ModelSelector dropdown** — models are now grouped by family header (QWEN / GEMMA / LLAMA / HERMES / PHI / DOLPHIN / MISTRAL / DEEPSEEK / …) in the Codex/Chat/Code dropdown, with a subscribe effect that re-fetches the list when any provider's `enabled`/`baseUrl` changes so users don't have to open Model Manager to see newly-enabled providers.

### E2E verified
5 tool-capable Ollama models, each in a fresh Codex chat, writing to `C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\<test-folder>\`:
- **gemma4:e4b** — both simple (`file_write hello.py`) and a real Codex-style task ("build cli.py with argparse add/list/clear + test_cli.py with 4 unittest tests + run `python -m unittest test_cli.py` and report") succeeded end-to-end. Full trace: `file_write cli.py (2556B)` → `file_write test_cli.py (3759B)` → `shell_execute python -m unittest test_cli.py` → real output `....\nRan 4 tests in 1.612s\nOK` → final summary. 3 clean tool blocks in the UI, single final answer, Memory badge fired on extraction.
- **qwen2.5-coder:3b** — after the `stripRanges` + `extractedFromContent` fix, chat UI is visually identical to gemma4's (tool blocks + single summary, zero raw JSON).
- **hermes3:8b** — clean native tool-call flow.
- **llama3.1:8b** — clean native tool-call flow (freshly pulled for this verification).
- **llama3.2:1b** — plumbing correct; the 1B model hallucinated a Unix-style `/Users/ddrob/Desktop/tiny.py` path that landed at `C:/Users/ddrob/Desktop/tiny.py` on Windows instead of in the workdir. Model-quality artefact, not a Codex bug. Documented for users on the smallest class of models.

### Changed
- Test suite 2202 → 2202 (full regression) after `tool-call-repair` gained `extractToolCallsWithRanges` + `stripRanges` + `findBalancedBraceEnd` + `findPrecedingOpenBrace`.

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.7. No breaking changes. No localStorage migration. Existing Codex chats continue to work; new chats benefit from the per-chat workspace isolation now that `chatId` threads through.

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Configurable Ollama endpoint (remote Ollama + `OLLAMA_HOST` env var support)** — GitHub Issue #31 by @k-wilkinson. The pre-2.3.7 app hardcoded `http://localhost:11434` in four places (the frontend `ollamaUrl()` helper used by every `/tags`/`/chat`/`/show`/`/pull`/`/generate` call, the Vite dev-proxy target, the Ollama provider's dev-mode `apiUrl()`, and the Rust `pull_model_stream` URL), so setting `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`, `192.168.1.x:11434` or any non-default port was silently ignored — the app reported "No local backend detected", model dropdowns stayed empty, Settings → Providers → Ollama → Endpoint field had zero effect, and the Test button always said Failed even when `curl` against the configured endpoint returned data. Now all four layers flow from a single `ollama_base` field that reads, in priority order, the persisted GUI value from `%APPDATA%/locally-uncensored/config.json`, the `OLLAMA_HOST` env var at startup (same semantics as Ollama itself), then the default. Accepts bare `host:port`, scheme-less host, or full URL. The Vite dev-proxy target is computed from `OLLAMA_HOST` at server startup so `OLLAMA_HOST=… npm run dev` also just works. The Rust SSRF allow-list in `proxy_localhost` was widened to accept the configured Ollama + ComfyUI hosts (everything else still blocked). 19 regression tests in `backend-urls.test.ts`.

### Fixed
- **`pull_model_stream` Rust command was hardcoded to `http://localhost:11434/api/pull`** — same root cause as Issue #31 but in a second place. Model-pull downloads ignored any user-configured Ollama endpoint. Now reads from `state.ollama_base`.

### Changed
- Test suite 2183 → 2202 green.

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.6. The default endpoint is still `http://localhost:11434` — existing users see zero behavior change. If you have `OLLAMA_HOST` in your environment (Docker, LAN, homelab) it's now honored; if you've edited Settings → Providers → Ollama → Endpoint that value now actually flows through the app.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Configurable ComfyUI host (remote ComfyUI support)** — Settings → ComfyUI → Host. Previously only the port was configurable; the host was hardcoded `localhost`, which meant users running ComfyUI in Docker, on a LAN machine, or on a headless homelab server couldn't point LU at it. The Host field accepts any hostname or IP. When the host resolves to the local machine (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `0.0.0.0`) the Start/Stop/Restart/Install/Path controls stay visible; when it's remote LU hides those controls and shows an amber hint that you manage the Python process on the server yourself. Requested in GitHub Discussion #1 by @ShoaibSajid (desktop LU + Ollama on server-1 + ComfyUI on server-1 docker). The mobile Remote proxy also honors the new host so mobile-dispatched ComfyUI calls reach the configured backend. 17 regression tests in `backend-urls.test.ts`.

### Fixed
- **ComfyUI port now actually persists across restarts** — pre-existing bug: `set_comfyui_port` wrote `comfyui_port` to `%APPDATA%/locally-uncensored/config.json`, but `AppState::new()` never read it back on startup. Users who set a custom port (e.g. because 8188 was taken) got their change reverted to 8188 on the next launch. New `load_comfy_config_values()` helper runs at startup and applies persisted port + host. Bundled with the host feature since they share the same config-load path.
- **OpenAI-compat local backends (LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp server, KoboldCpp, oobabooga, Jan, GPT4All, Aphrodite, SGLang, TGI, LocalAI, TabbyAPI) can actually be reached from LU's Tauri webview** — `openai-provider.ts` used plain `fetch()` for `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`, and `checkConnection`, which CORS-blocks localhost requests inside the Tauri WebView (only Ollama had CORS open). The "Test" button in Settings → Providers always showed **Failed** and models never appeared in the dropdown even when the backend was obviously reachable via curl. Fix: each HTTP call now picks `localFetch`/`localFetchStream` when the provider baseUrl hostname is local (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1`/`0.0.0.0`), which routes through the Rust proxy with a direct-fetch fallback. Cloud endpoints (OpenAI proper, OpenRouter, Groq, Together, DeepSeek, Mistral, etc.) skip the proxy since they don't have the localhost CORS issue. Surfaced during v2.3.6 live E2E against a real LM Studio server on :1234; the Djoks auto-detection fix (v2.3.5) was detecting + pre-enabling the provider correctly, but the actual /v1/* calls were silently CORS-rejected.

### Changed
- Test suite 2166 → 2183 green (+17 regression tests for `setComfyHost` / `isComfyLocal` / `comfyuiUrl` / `comfyuiWsUrl` with custom hosts).

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.5. No breaking changes. The default host is still `localhost` — existing users see zero behavior change unless they explicitly switch to a remote host.

## [2.3.5] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **LM Studio (and other openai-compat backends) now show up when Ollama is also running** — `AppShell`'s post-onboarding detection only auto-enabled a backend when exactly one was detected. With two or more (the very common Ollama + LM Studio setup) it showed the `BackendSelector` modal but pre-enabled nothing. Users who dismissed the modal saw zero LM Studio models in the chat dropdown even though LM Studio was clearly running — looked from the outside like "LU doesn't recognize my models". Reported via Discord `#help-chat` on 2026-04-21. Fix: the first non-Ollama detected backend is always pre-enabled (Ollama is left untouched since it has its own provider slot); the selector stays as an educational picker so you can change which openai-compat backend is primary. Reproduced live with a mock LM Studio endpoint on port 1234 with Ollama also running, verified the fix against the same setup on the release binary. Five regression tests in `AppShell-backend-autoenable.test.ts`.
- **No more terminal flashes on Windows when LU kills subprocesses** — two Windows-branch `Command::new` spawns were missing `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`: the `taskkill` calls in `AppState::Drop` that tear down ComfyUI + Claude Code process trees on LU shutdown, and the `docker pull` / `docker run` in `search.rs` that installs SearXNG. Both briefly flashed a console window at the user. Now 100% of Windows-branch subprocess spawns carry the flag. LU itself never spawns LM Studio (only talks HTTP to a user-run instance), so the "no terminal when using LM Studio" guarantee was already true on that path; this tightens the peripheral surface.
- **`setup.bat` / `setup.ps1` / `setup.sh` no longer mislead end-users into dev mode** — the scripts launched `npm run dev` (Vite + browser), which has fewer features than the installed Tauri app and produced confusing `[vite] http proxy error: /system_stats ECONNREFUSED` when ComfyUI wasn't installed yet. Reported via GitHub issue #30. Fix: all three setup scripts now start with a clear dev-mode banner, a link to the installer in Releases, and a one-key prompt to continue or exit. The README's "Windows One-Click Setup" section was also reframed as "For Contributors — Dev-Mode Setup" with an explicit pointer to the installer for end-users.

### Changed
- Test suite 2161 → 2166 green (+5 regression tests for the backend-autoenable fix).

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.4. No breaking changes. No localStorage migration. Everything from v2.3.4 (chat-history persistence, Ollama 0.21 compat, Codex loop guard, stop-button fast-path, stale-chip fix, 12-backend auto-detect, Mobile Remote, Codex streaming, Agent Mode rewrite, ERNIE-Image, Qwen 3.6, 75+ one-click model downloads) still applies.

## [2.3.4] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Chat history now survives updates** — `isTauri()` was checking the v1 global `window.__TAURI__`, but Tauri 2 renamed it to `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`. Inside the packaged `.exe` every Tauri-only backend command (`backup_stores`, `restore_stores`, `set_onboarding_done`, ComfyUI manager, whisper, process control) silently fell through to the dev-mode fetch path and no-op'd. Fix: dual-global check + 100 ms × 50-tick polling loop that waits for the Tauri global to appear before arming the backup triad (required because `withGlobalTauri: true` sets the global asynchronously on slow cold-starts). Full destructive wipe+restore roundtrip live-verified on the release binary.
- **Backup cadence tightened** — safety-net interval 30 s → 5 s; added event-driven debounced backup on every chat mutation (1 s after the last message); added `beforeunload` sync flush for graceful quits. All three legs run unconditionally with a `__ts` marker so the snapshot is always non-empty.
- **Ollama 0.21 / 0.20.7 compatibility** — auto-upgraded Ollama rejects pre-existing models with `HTTP 404 model not found` on `/api/show` when the on-disk manifest lacks the `capabilities` field. New `modelHealthStore` + top-of-app `StaleModelsBanner` + Header Lichtschalter chip detect stale models and offer a one-click re-pull that verifies the fix before clearing the warning. Error parser tolerates 400/404/Rust-proxy-wrapped-500 forms.
- **Stale-chip state leak** — switching from a stale model to a fresh one now clears the red toggle and the inline chip immediately; switching between two different stale models re-pins correctly.
- **Codex infinite-loop guard** — small 3 B coder models (qwen2.5-coder:3b, llama3.2:1b) could loop forever repeating the same `file_write + shell_execute` batch when a test failed. Codex now tracks per-iteration batch signatures and halts after two consecutive identical batches with "same tool sequence repeated N× — try a larger model".
- **Stop button instant** — `abort.signal.aborted` checked at the top of the `for await` chat stream and the NDJSON reader loop; `reader.cancel()` on abort. No more 30–60 s of thinking-token leak after clicking Stop on a Gemma-4 response.
- **`isHtmlSnippet` export missing** — 19 failing CodeBlock tests fixed.
- **Create view crashed silently in browser bundle** — `comfyui.getKnownFileSizes` used CommonJS `require('../api/discover')` which Vite/Rolldown can't resolve. Replaced with dynamic `import()`.
- **flux2 CFG scale test regression** — test asserted 3.5 (Z-Image default); corrected to 1.0 (flux2 default).

### Changed
- Test suite 2105 → 2161 green (+56 regression tests covering backup triad, Codex loop detection, `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` detection, stale-manifest parsing).

### Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing chats and settings survive the upgrade via the now-working restore path.
- Existing `phi4:14b`, `dolphin3:8b`, and other pre-0.15 Ollama models will show in the stale banner. Click "Refresh all" to re-pull; manifests will be regenerated with the new `capabilities` field.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Model unloading broken** — unload button and automatic unload on model switch silently failed (missing `prompt` field in Ollama `/generate` call), causing models to stay in RAM indefinitely
- **No GPU offloading** — models ran entirely on CPU/RAM instead of GPU; added `num_gpu: 99` to all Ollama chat calls so layers are offloaded to GPU automatically (Ollama splits between GPU and CPU if VRAM is insufficient)
- **Silent error swallowing** — unload errors were caught and discarded with `.catch(() => {})`; now logged to console for debugging

- **Variant selector** — dropdown for multi-size model downloads in Discover
- **HOT/AGENT badges** — recommended models highlighted in Model Manager
- **web_fetch tool** — fetches URLs and extracts readable text content (HTML → text)

### Changed
- **UI redesign (Linear/Arc style)** — compact header, collapsible settings, list-view models, minimal borders
- **Sidebar** — narrower, minimal hover states, smaller text
- **Settings** — collapsible sections, inline sliders, compact toggles
- **Model Manager** — list layout instead of card grid
- **Start screen** — clean LU logo only, smooth transition to chat

- **Tool call display** — inline colored text instead of colored boxes

### Fixed
- DuckDuckGo search snippet truncation (regex now captures full HTML content)
- DDG URL extraction from redirect wrappers
- Context window exhaustion after many tool calls ("Failed to fetch" error)

### Removed
- Old standalone Agent View (replaced by in-chat Agent Mode)
